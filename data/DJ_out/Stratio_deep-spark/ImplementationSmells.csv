In heav'n` That largeliest of his light partakes` was I` Witness of things` which to relate again Surpasseth power of him who comes from thence; For that` so near approaching its desire Our intellect is to such depth absorb'd` That memory cannot follow. Nathless all` That in my thoughts I of that sacred realm Could store` shall now be matter of my song. Benign Apollo! this last labour aid` And make me such a vessel of thy worth` As thy own laurel claims of me belov'd. Thus far hath one of steep Parnassus' brows Suffic'd me; henceforth there is need of both For my remaining enterprise Do thou Enter into my bosom` and there breathe So` as when Marsyas by thy hand was dragg'd Forth from his limbs unsheath'd. O power divine! If thou to me of shine impart so much` That of that happy realm the shadow'd form Trac'd in my thoughts I may set forth to view` Thou shalt behold me of thy favour'd tree Come to the foot` and crown myself with leaves; For to that honour thou` and my high theme Will fit me. If but seldom` mighty Sire! To grace his triumph gathers thence a wreath Caesar or bard (more shame for human wills Deprav'd) joy to the Delphic god must spring From the Pierian foliage` when one breast Is with such thirst inspir'd. From a small spark Great flame hath risen: after me perchance Others with better voice may pray` and gain From the Cirrhaean city answer kind. Through diver passages` the world's bright lamp Rises to mortals` but through that which joins Four circles with the threefold cross` in best Course` and in happiest constellation set He comes` and to the worldly wax best gives Its temper and impression. Morning there` Here eve was by almost such passage made; And whiteness had o'erspread that hemisphere` Blackness the other part; when to the left I saw Beatrice turn'd` and on the sun Gazing` as never eagle fix'd his ken. As from the first a second beam is wont To issue` and reflected upwards rise` E'en as a pilgrim bent on his return` So of her act` that through the eyesight pass'd Into my fancy` mine was form'd; and straight` Beyond our mortal wont` I fix'd mine eyes Upon the sun. Much is allowed us there` That here exceeds our pow'r; thanks to the place Made for the dwelling of the human kind I suffer'd it not long` and yet so long That I beheld it bick'ring sparks around` As iron that comes boiling from the fire. And suddenly upon the day appear'd A day new-ris'n` as he` who hath the power` Had with another sun bedeck'd the sky. Her eyes fast fix'd on the eternal wheels` Beatrice stood unmov'd; and I with ken Fix'd upon her` from upward gaze remov'd At her aspect` such inwardly became As Glaucus` when he tasted of the herb` That made him peer among the ocean gods; Words may not tell of that transhuman change: And therefore let the example serve` though weak` For those whom grace hath better proof in store If I were only what thou didst create` Then newly` Love! by whom the heav'n is rul'd` Thou know'st` who by thy light didst bear me up. Whenas the wheel which thou dost ever guide` Desired Spirit! with its harmony Temper'd of thee and measur'd` charm'd mine ear` Then seem'd to me so much of heav'n to blaze With the sun's flame` that rain or flood ne'er made A lake so broad. The newness of the sound` And that great light` inflam'd me with desire` Keener than e'er was felt` to know their cause. Whence she who saw me` clearly as myself` To calm my troubled mind` before I ask'd` Open'd her lips` and gracious thus began: 'With false imagination thou thyself Mak'st dull` so that thou seest not the thing` Which thou hadst seen` had that been shaken off. Thou art not on the earth as thou believ'st; For light'ning scap'd from its own proper place Ne'er ran` as thou hast hither now return'd.' Although divested of my first-rais'd doubt` By those brief words` accompanied with smiles` Yet in new doubt was I entangled more` And said: 'Already satisfied` I rest From admiration deep` but now admire How I above those lighter bodies rise.' Whence` after utt'rance of a piteous sigh` She tow'rds me bent her eyes` with such a look` As on her frenzied child a mother casts; Then thus began: 'Among themselves all things Have order; and from hence the form` which makes The universe resemble God. In this The higher creatures see the printed steps Of that eternal worth` which is the end Whither the line is drawn. All natures lean` In this their order` diversely` some more` Some less approaching to their primal source. Thus they to different havens are mov'd on Through the vast sea of being` and each one With instinct giv'n` that bears it in its course; This to the lunar sphere directs the fire` This prompts the hearts of mortal animals` This the brute earth together knits` and binds. Nor only creatures` void of intellect` Are aim'd at by this bow; but even those` That have intelligence and love` are pierc'd. That Providence` who so well orders all` With her own light makes ever calm the heaven` In which the substance` that hath greatest speed` Is turn'd: and thither now` as to our seat Predestin'd` we are carried by the force Of that strong cord` that never looses dart` But at fair aim and glad. Yet is it true` That as ofttimes but ill accords the form To the design of art` through sluggishness Of unreplying matter` so this course Is sometimes quitted by the creature` who Hath power` directed thus` to bend elsewhere; As from a cloud the fire is seen to fall` From its original impulse warp'd` to earth` By vicious fondness. Thou no more admire Thy soaring` (if I rightly deem`) than lapse Of torrent downwards from a mountain's height. There would in thee for wonder be more cause` If` free of hind'rance` thou hadst fix'd thyself Below` like fire unmoving on the earth.' So said` she turn'd toward the heav'n her face.\" }` " + "{ \"canto\": \"II\"` \"text\": \"All ye` who in small bark have following sail'd` Eager to listen` on the advent'rous track Of my proud keel` that singing cuts its way` Backward return with speed` and your own shores Revisit` nor put out to open sea` Where losing me` perchance ye may remain Bewilder'd in deep maze. The way I pass Ne'er yet was run: Minerva breathes the gale` Apollo guides me` and another Nine To my rapt sight the arctic beams reveal. Ye other few` who have outstretch'd the neck. Timely for food of angels` on which here They live` yet never know satiety` Through the deep brine ye fearless may put out Your vessel` marking` well the furrow broad Before you in the wave` that on both sides Equal returns. Those` glorious` who pass'd o'er To Colchos` wonder'd not as ye will do` When they saw Jason following the plough. The increate perpetual thirst` that draws Toward the realm of God's own form` bore us Swift almost as the heaven ye behold. Beatrice upward gaz'd` and I on her` And in such space as on the notch a dart Is plac'd` then loosen'd flies` I saw myself Arriv'd` where wond'rous thing engag'd my sight. Whence she` to whom no work of mine was hid` Turning to me` with aspect glad as fair` Bespake me: 'Gratefully direct thy mind To God` through whom to this first star we come.' Me seem'd as if a cloud had cover'd us` Translucent` solid` firm` and polish'd bright` Like adamant` which the sun's beam had smit Within itself the ever-during pearl Receiv'd us` as the wave a ray of light Receives` and rests unbroken. If I then Was of corporeal frame` and it transcend Our weaker thought` how one dimension thus Another could endure` which needs must be If body enter body` how much more Must the desire inflame us to behold That essence` which discovers by what means God and our nature join'd! There will be seen That which we hold through faith` not shown by proof` But in itself intelligibly plain` E'en as the truth that man at first believes. I answered: 'Lady! I with thoughts devout` Such as I best can frame` give thanks to Him` Who hath remov'd me from the mortal world. But tell` I pray thee` whence the gloomy spots Upon this body` which below on earth Give rise to talk of Cain in fabling quaint?' She somewhat smil'd` then spake: 'If mortals err In their opinion` when the key of sense Unlocks not` surely wonder's weapon keen Ought not to pierce thee; since thou find'st` the wings Of reason to pursue the senses' flight Are short. But what thy own thought is` declare.' Then I: 'What various here above appears` Is caus'd` I deem` by bodies dense or rare.' She then resum'd: 'Thou certainly wilt see In falsehood thy belief o'erwhelm'd` if well Thou listen to the arguments` which I Shall bring to face it. The eighth sphere displays Numberless lights` the which in kind and size May be remark'd of different aspects; If rare or dense of that were cause alone` One single virtue then would be in all` Alike distributed` or more` or less. Different virtues needs must be the fruits Of formal principles` and these` save one` Will by thy reasoning be destroy'd. Beside` If rarity were of that dusk the cause` Which thou inquirest` either in some part That planet must throughout be void` nor fed With its own matter; or` as bodies share Their fat and leanness` in like manner this Must in its volume change the leaves. The first` If it were true` had through the sun's eclipse Been manifested` by transparency Of light` as through aught rare beside effus'd. But this is not. Therefore remains to see The other cause: and if the other fall` Erroneous so must prove what seem'd to thee. If not from side to side this rarity Pass through` there needs must be a limit` whence Its contrary no further lets it pass. And hence the beam` that from without proceeds` Must be pour'd back` as colour comes` through glass Reflected` which behind it lead conceals. Now wilt thou say` that there of murkier hue Than in the other part the ray is shown` By being thence refracted farther back. From this perplexity will free thee soon Experience` if thereof thou trial make` The fountain whence your arts derive their streame. Three mirrors shalt thou take` and two remove From thee alike` and more remote the third. Betwixt the former pair` shall meet thine eyes; Then turn'd toward them` cause behind thy back A light to stand` that on the three shall shine` And thus reflected come to thee from all. Though that beheld most distant do not stretch A space so ample` yet in brightness thou Will own it equaling the rest. But now` As under snow the ground` if the warm ray Smites it` remains dismantled of the hue And cold` that cover'd it before` so thee` Dismantled in thy mind` I will inform With light so lively` that the tremulous beam Shall quiver where it falls. Within the heaven` Where peace divine inhabits` circles round A body` in whose virtue dies the being Of all that it contains. The following heaven` That hath so many lights` this being divides` Through different essences` from it distinct` And yet contain'd within it. The other orbs Their separate distinctions variously Dispose` for their own seed and produce apt. Thus do these organs of the world proceed` As thou beholdest now` from step to step` Their influences from above deriving` And thence transmitting downwards. Mark me well` How through this passage to the truth I ford` The truth thou lov'st` that thou henceforth alone` May'st know to keep the shallows` safe` untold. 'The virtue and motion of the sacred orbs` As mallet by the workman's hand` must needs By blessed movers be inspir'd. This heaven` Made beauteous by so many luminaries` From the deep spirit` that moves its circling sphere` Its image takes an impress as a seal: And as the soul` that dwells within your dust` Through members different` yet together form'd` In different pow'rs resolves itself; e'en so The intellectual efficacy unfolds Its goodness multiplied throughout the stars; On its own unity revolving still. Different virtue compact different Makes with the precious body it enlivens` With which it knits` as life in you is knit. From its original nature full of joy` The virtue mingled through the body shines` As joy through pupil of the living eye. From hence proceeds` that which from light to light Seems different` and not from dense or rare. This is the formal cause` that generates Proportion'd to its power` the dusk or clear.'\" }` "+ "{ \"canto\": \"III\"` \"text\": \"That sun` which erst with love my bosom warm'd Had of fair truth unveil'd the sweet aspect` By proof of right` and of the false reproof; And I` to own myself convinc'd and free Of doubt` as much as needed` rais'd my head Erect for speech. But soon a sight appear'd` Which` so intent to mark it` held me fix'd` That of confession I no longer thought.

Straight to the shadow which for converse seem'd Most earnest` I addressed me` and began` As one by over-eagerness perplex'd: 'O spirit` born for joy! who in the rays Of life eternal` of that sweetness know'st The flavour` which` not tasted` passes far All apprehension` me it well would please` If thou wouldst tell me of thy name` and this Your station here.' Whence she` with kindness prompt` And eyes glist'ning with smiles: 'Our charity` To any wish by justice introduc'd` Bars not the door` no more than she above` Who would have all her court be like herself. I was a virgin sister in the earth; And if thy mind observe me well` this form` With such addition grac'd of loveliness` Will not conceal me long` but thou wilt know Piccarda` in the tardiest sphere thus plac'd` Here 'mid these other blessed also blest. Our hearts` whose high affections burn alone With pleasure` from the Holy Spirit conceiv'd` Admitted to his order dwell in joy. And this condition` which appears so low` Is for this cause assign'd us` that our vows Were in some part neglected and made void.' Whence I to her replied: 'Something divine Beams in your countenance` wond'rous fair` From former knowledge quite transmuting you. Therefore to recollect was I so slow. But what thou sayst hath to my memory Given now such aid` that to retrace your forms Is easier. Yet inform me` ye` who here Are happy` long ye for a higher place More to behold` and more in love to dwell?' She with those other spirits gently smil'd` Then answer'd with such gladness` that she seem'd With love's first flame to glow: 'Brother! our will Is in composure settled by the power Of charity` who makes us will alone What we possess` and nought beyond desire; If we should wish to be exalted more` Then must our wishes jar with the high will Of him` who sets us here` which in these orbs Thou wilt confess not possible` if here To be in charity must needs befall` And if her nature well thou contemplate. Rather it is inherent in this state Of blessedness` to keep ourselves within The divine will` by which our wills with his Are one. So that as we from step to step Are plac'd throughout this kingdom` pleases all` E'en as our King` who in us plants his will; And in his will is our tranquillity; It is the mighty ocean` whither tends Whatever it creates and nature makes.' Then saw I clearly how each spot in heav'n Is Paradise` though with like gracious dew The supreme virtue show'r not over all. But as it chances` if one sort of food Hath satiated` and of another still The appetite remains` that this is ask'd` And thanks for that return'd; e'en so did I In word and motion` bent from her to learn What web it was` through which she had not drawn The shuttle to its point. She thus began: 'Exalted worth and perfectness of life The Lady higher up enshrine in heaven` By whose pure laws upon your nether earth The robe and veil they wear` to that intent` That e'en till death they may keep watch or sleep With their great bridegroom` who accepts each vow` Which to his gracious pleasure love conforms. from the world` to follow her` when young Escap'd; and` in her vesture mantling me` Made promise of the way her sect enjoins. Thereafter men` for ill than good more apt` Forth snatch'd me from the pleasant cloister's pale. God knows how after that my life was fram'd. This other splendid shape` which thou beholdst At my right side` burning with all the light Of this our orb` what of myself I tell May to herself apply. From her` like me A sister` with like violence were torn The saintly folds` that shaded her fair brows. E'en when she to the world again was brought In spite of her own will and better wont` Yet not for that the bosom's inward veil Did she renounce. This is the luminary Of mighty Constance` who from that loud blast` Which blew the second over Suabia's realm` That power produc'd` which was the third and last.' She ceas'd from further talk` and then began 'Ave Maria' singing` and with that song Vanish'd` as heavy substance through deep wave. Mine eye` that far as it was capable` Pursued her` when in dimness she was lost` Turn'd to the mark where greater want impell'd` And bent on Beatrice all its gaze. But she as light'ning beam'd upon my looks: So that the sight sustain'd it not at first. Whence I to question her became less prompt.\" }` "+ "{ \"canto\": \"IV\"` \"text\": \"Between two kinds of food` both equally Remote and tempting` first a man might die Of hunger` ere he one could freely choose.

Silent was I` yet desire Was painted in my looks; and thus I spake My wish more earnestly than language could. As Daniel` when the haughty king he freed From ire` that spurr'd him on to deeds unjust And violent; so look'd Beatrice then. 'Well I discern`' she thus her words address'd` 'How contrary desires each way constrain thee` So that thy anxious thought is in itself Bound up and stifled` nor breathes freely forth. Thou arguest; if the good intent remain; What reason that another's violence Should stint the measure of my fair desert? 'Cause too thou findst for doubt` in that it seems` That spirits to the stars` as Plato deem'd` Return. These are the questions which thy will Urge equally; and therefore I the first Of that will treat which hath the more of gall. Of seraphim he who is most ensky'd` Moses and Samuel` and either John` Choose which thou wilt` nor even Mary's self` Have not in any other heav'n their seats` Than have those spirits which so late thou saw'st; Nor more or fewer years exist; but all Make the first circle beauteous` diversely Partaking of sweet life` as more or less Afflation of eternal bliss pervades them. Here were they shown thee` not that fate assigns This for their sphere` but for a sign to thee Of that celestial furthest from the height. Thus needs` that ye may apprehend` we speak: Since from things sensible alone ye learn That` which digested rightly after turns To intellectual. For no other cause The scripture` condescending graciously To your perception` hands and feet to God Attributes` nor so means: and holy church Doth represent with human countenance Gabriel` and Michael` and him who made Tobias whole. Unlike what here thou seest` The judgment of Timaeus` who affirms Each soul restor'd to its particular star` Believing it to have been taken thence` When nature gave it to inform her mold: Since to appearance his intention is E'en what his words declare: or else to shun Derision` haply thus he hath disguis'd His true opinion. If his meaning be` That to the influencing of these orbs revert The honour and the blame in human acts` Perchance he doth not wholly miss the truth. This principle` not understood aright` Erewhile perverted well nigh all the world; So that it fell to fabled names of Jove` And Mercury` and Mars. That other doubt` Which moves thee` is less harmful; for it brings No peril of removing thee from me. 'That` to the eye of man` our justice seems Unjust` is argument for faith` and not For heretic declension. To the end This truth may stand more clearly in your view` I will content thee even to thy wish 'If violence be` when that which suffers` nought Consents to that which forceth` not for this These spirits stood exculpate. For the will` That will not` still survives unquench'd` and doth As nature doth in fire` tho' violence Wrest it a thousand times; for` if it yield Or more or less` so far it follows force. And thus did these` whom they had power to seek The hallow'd place again. In them` had will Been perfect` such as once upon the bars Held Laurence firm` or wrought in Scaevola To his own hand remorseless` to the path` Whence they were drawn` their steps had hasten'd back` When liberty return'd: but in too few Resolve so steadfast dwells. And by these words If duly weigh'd` that argument is void` Which oft might have perplex'd thee still. But now Another question thwarts thee` which to solve Might try thy patience without better aid. I have` no doubt` instill'd into thy mind` That blessed spirit may not lie; since near The source of primal truth it dwells for aye: And thou might'st after of Piccarda learn That Constance held affection to the veil; So that she seems to contradict me here. Not seldom` brother` it hath chanc'd for men To do what they had gladly left undone` Yet to shun peril they have done amiss: E'en as Alcmaeon` at his father's suit Slew his own mother` so made pitiless Not to lose pity. On this point bethink thee` That force and will are blended in such wise As not to make the' offence excusable. Absolute will agrees not to the wrong` That inasmuch as there is fear of woe From non-compliance` it agrees. Of will Thus absolute Piccarda spake` and I Of th' other; so that both have truly said.' Such was the flow of that pure rill` that well'd From forth the fountain of all truth; and such The rest` that to my wond'ring thoughts I found. 'O thou of primal love the prime delight! Goddess!' I straight reply'd` 'whose lively words Still shed new heat and vigour through my soul! Affection fails me to requite thy grace With equal sum of gratitude: be his To recompense` who sees and can reward thee. Well I discern` that by that truth alone Enlighten'd` beyond which no truth may roam` Our mind can satisfy her thirst to know: Therein she resteth` e'en as in his lair The wild beast` soon as she hath reach'd that bound` And she hath power to reach it; else desire Were given to no end. And thence doth doubt Spring` like a shoot` around the stock of truth; And it is nature which from height to height On to the summit prompts us. This invites` This doth assure me` lady` rev'rently To ask thee of other truth` that yet Is dark to me. I fain would know` if man By other works well done may so supply The failure of his vows` that in your scale They lack not weight.' I spake; and on me straight Beatrice look'd with eyes that shot forth sparks Of love celestial in such copious stream` That` virtue sinking in me overpower'd` I turn'd` and downward bent confus'd my sight.\" }` "+ "{ \"canto\": \"V\"` \"text\": \"'If beyond earthly wont` the flame of love Illume me` so that I o'ercome thy power Of vision` marvel not: but learn the cause In that perfection of the sight` which soon As apprehending` hasteneth on to reach The good it apprehends.

'This would'st thou know` if failure of the vow By other service may be so supplied` As from self-question to assure the soul.' Thus she her words` not heedless of my wish` Began; and thus` as one who breaks not off Discourse` continued in her saintly strain. 'Supreme of gifts` which God creating gave Of his free bounty` sign most evident Of goodness` and in his account most priz'd` Was liberty of will` the boon wherewith All intellectual creatures` and them sole He hath endow'd. Hence now thou mayst infer Of what high worth the vow` which so is fram'd That when man offers` God well-pleas'd accepts; For in the compact between God and him` This treasure` such as I describe it to thee` He makes the victim` and of his own act. What compensation therefore may he find? If that` whereof thou hast oblation made` By using well thou think'st to consecrate` Thou would'st of theft do charitable deed. Thus I resolve thee of the greater point. 'But forasmuch as holy church` herein Dispensing` seems to contradict the truth I have discover'd to thee` yet behooves Thou rest a little longer at the board` Ere the crude aliment` which thou hast taken` Digested fitly to nutrition turn. Open thy mind to what I now unfold` And give it inward keeping. Knowledge comes Of learning well retain'd` unfruitful else. 'This sacrifice in essence of two things Consisteth; one is that` whereof 't is made` The covenant the other. For the last` It ne'er is cancell'd if not kept: and hence I spake erewhile so strictly of its force. For this it was enjoin'd the Israelites` Though leave were giv'n them` as thou know'st` to change The offering` still to offer. Th' other part` The matter and the substance of the vow` May well be such` to that without offence It may for other substance be exchang'd. But at his own discretion none may shift The burden on his shoulders` unreleas'd By either key` the yellow and the white. Nor deem of any change` as less than vain` If the last bond be not within the new Included` as the quatre in the six. No satisfaction therefore can be paid For what so precious in the balance weighs` That all in counterpoise must kick the beam. Take then no vow at random: ta'en` with faith Preserve it; yet not bent` as Jephthah once` Blindly to execute a rash resolve` Whom better it had suited to exclaim` 'I have done ill`' than to redeem his pledge By doing worse or` not unlike to him In folly` that great leader of the Greeks: Whence` on the alter` Iphigenia mourn'd Her virgin beauty` and hath since made mourn Both wise and simple` even all` who hear Of so fell sacrifice. Be ye more staid` O Christians` not` like feather` by each wind Removable: nor think to cleanse ourselves In every water. Either testament` The old and new` is yours: and for your guide The shepherd of the church let this suffice To save you. When by evil lust entic'd` Remember ye be men` not senseless beasts; Nor let the Jew` who dwelleth in your streets` Hold you in mock'ry. Be not` as the lamb` That` fickle wanton` leaves its mother's milk` To dally with itself in idle play.' Such were the words that Beatrice spake: These ended` to that region` where the world Is liveliest` full of fond desire she turn'd. Though mainly prompt new question to propose` Her silence and chang'd look did keep me dumb. And as the arrow` ere the cord is still` Leapeth unto its mark; so on we sped Into the second realm. There I beheld The dame` so joyous enter` that the orb Grew brighter at her smiles; and` if the star Were mov'd to gladness` what then was my cheer` Whom nature hath made apt for every change! As in a quiet and clear lake the fish` If aught approach them from without` do draw Towards it` deeming it their food; so drew Full more than thousand splendours towards us` And in each one was heard: 'Lo! one arriv'd To multiply our loves!' and as each came The shadow` streaming forth effulgence new` Witness'd augmented joy. Here` reader! think` If thou didst miss the sequel of my tale` To know the rest how sorely thou wouldst crave; And thou shalt see what vehement desire Possess'd me` as soon as these had met my view` To know their state.

'My liege` it doth enhance the joy thy words Infuse into me` mighty as it is` To think my gladness manifest to thee` As to myself` who own it` when thou lookst Into the source and limit of all good` There` where thou markest that which thou dost speak` Thence priz'd of me the more. Glad thou hast made me. Now make intelligent` clearing the doubt Thy speech hath raised in me; for much I muse` How bitter can spring up` when sweet is sown.' I thus inquiring; he forthwith replied: 'If I have power to show one truth` soon that Shall face thee` which thy questioning declares Behind thee now conceal'd. The Good` that guides And blessed makes this realm` which thou dost mount` Ordains its providence to be the virtue In these great bodies: nor th' all perfect Mind Upholds their nature merely` but in them Their energy to save: for nought` that lies Within the range of that unerring bow` But is as level with the destin'd aim` As ever mark to arrow's point oppos'd. Were it not thus` these heavens` thou dost visit` Would their effect so work` it would not be Art` but destruction; and this may not chance` If th' intellectual powers` that move these stars` Fail not` or who` first faulty made them fail. Wilt thou this truth more clearly evidenc'd?' To whom I thus: 'It is enough: no fear` I see` lest nature in her part should tire.' He straight rejoin'd: 'Say` were it worse for man` If he liv'd not in fellowship on earth?' 'Yea`' answer'd I; 'nor here a reason needs.' 'And may that be` if different estates Grow not of different duties in your life? Consult your teacher` and he tells you 'no.'' Thus did he come` deducing to this point` And then concluded: 'For this cause behooves` The roots` from whence your operations come` Must differ. Therefore one is Solon born; Another` Xerxes; and Melchisidec A third; and he a fourth` whose airy voyage Cost him his son. In her circuitous course` Nature` that is the seal to mortal wax` Doth well her art` but no distinctions owns 'Twixt one or other household. Hence befalls That Esau is so wide of Jacob: hence Quirinus of so base a father springs` He dates from Mars his lineage. Were it not That providence celestial overrul'd` Nature` in generation` must the path Trac'd by the generator` still pursue Unswervingly. Thus place I in thy sight That` which was late behind thee. But` in sign Of more affection for thee` 't is my will Thou wear this corollary. Nature ever Finding discordant fortune` like all seed Out of its proper climate` thrives but ill. And were the world below content to mark And work on the foundation nature lays` It would not lack supply of excellence. But ye perversely to religion strain Him` who was born to gird on him the sword` And of the fluent phrasemen make your king; Therefore your steps have wander'd from the paths.'\" }` "+ "{ \"canto\": \"IX\"` \"text\": \"After solution of my doubt` thy Charles` O fair Clemenza` of the treachery spake That must befall his seed: but` 'Tell it not`' Said he` 'and let the destin'd years come round.' Nor may I tell thee more` save that the meed Of sorrow well-deserv'd shall quit your wrongs. And now the visage of that saintly light Was to the sun` that fills it` turn'd again` As to the good` whose plenitude of bliss Sufficeth all. O ye misguided souls! Infatuate` who from such a good estrange Your hearts` and bend your gaze on vanity` Alas for you!--And lo! toward me` next` Another of those splendent forms approach'd` That` by its outward bright'ning` testified The will it had to pleasure me. The eyes Of Beatrice` resting` as before` Firmly upon me` manifested forth Approval of my wish. 'And O`' I cried` 'Blest spirit! quickly be my will perform'd; And prove thou to me` that my inmost thoughts I can reflect on thee.' Thereat the light` That yet was new to me` from the recess` Where it before was singing` thus began` As one who joys in kindness: 'In that part Of the deprav'd Italian land` which lies Between Rialto` and the fountain-springs Of Brenta and of Piava` there doth rise` But to no lofty eminence` a hill` From whence erewhile a firebrand did descend` That sorely sheet the region. From one root I and it sprang; my name on earth Cunizza: And here I glitter` for that by its light This star o'ercame me. Yet I naught repine` Nor grudge myself the cause of this my lot` Which haply vulgar hearts can scarce conceive. 'This jewel` that is next me in our heaven` Lustrous and costly` great renown hath left` And not to perish` ere these hundred years Five times absolve their round. Consider thou` If to excel be worthy man's endeavour` When such life may attend the first. Yet they Care not for this` the crowd that now are girt By Adice and Tagliamento` still Impenitent` tho' scourg'd. The hour is near` When for their stubbornness at Padua's marsh The water shall be chang'd` that laves Vicena And where Cagnano meets with Sile` one Lords it` and bears his head aloft` for whom The web is now a-warping. Feltro too Shall sorrow for its godless shepherd's fault` Of so deep stain` that never` for the like` Was Malta's bar unclos'd. Too large should be The skillet` that would hold Ferrara's blood` And wearied he` who ounce by ounce would weight it` The which this priest` in show of party-zeal` Courteous will give; nor will the gift ill suit The country's custom. We descry above` Mirrors` ye call them thrones` from which to us Reflected shine the judgments of our God: Whence these our sayings we avouch for good.' She ended` and appear'd on other thoughts Intent` re-ent'ring on the wheel she late Had left. That other joyance meanwhile wax'd A thing to marvel at` in splendour glowing` Like choicest ruby stricken by the sun` For` in that upper clime` effulgence comes Of gladness` as here laughter: and below` As the mind saddens` murkier grows the shade. 'God seeth all: and in him is thy sight`' Said I` 'blest Spirit! Therefore will of his Cannot to thee be dark. Why then delays Thy voice to satisfy my wish untold` That voice which joins the inexpressive song` Pastime of heav'n` the which those ardours sing` That cowl them with six shadowing wings outspread? I would not wait thy asking` wert thou known To me` as thoroughly I to thee am known.' He forthwith answ'ring` thus his words began: 'The valley' of waters` widest next to that Which doth the earth engarland` shapes its course` Between discordant shores` against the sun Inward so far` it makes meridian there` Where was before th' horizon. Of that vale Dwelt I upon the shore` 'twixt Ebro's stream And Macra's` that divides with passage brief Genoan bounds from Tuscan. East and west Are nearly one to Begga and my land` Whose haven erst was with its own blood warm. Who knew my name were wont to call me Folco: And I did bear impression of this heav'n` That now bears mine: for not with fiercer flame Glow'd Belus' daughter` injuring alike Sichaeus and Creusa` than did I` Long as it suited the unripen'd down That fledg'd my cheek: nor she of Rhodope` That was beguiled of Demophoon; Nor Jove's son` when the charms of Iole Were shrin'd within his heart. And yet there hides No sorrowful repentance here` but mirth` Not for the fault (that doth not come to mind)` But for the virtue` whose o'erruling sway And providence have wrought thus quaintly. Here The skill is look'd into` that fashioneth With such effectual working` and the good Discern'd` accruing to this upper world From that below. But fully to content Thy wishes` all that in this sphere have birth` Demands my further parle. Inquire thou wouldst` Who of this light is denizen` that here Beside me sparkles` as the sun-beam doth On the clear wave. Know then` the soul of Rahab Is in that gladsome harbour` to our tribe United` and the foremost rank assign'd. He to that heav'n` at which the shadow ends Of your sublunar world` was taken up` First` in Christ's triumph` of all souls redeem'd: For well behoov'd` that` in some part of heav'n` She should remain a trophy` to declare The mighty contest won with either palm; For that she favour'd first the high exploit Of Joshua on the holy land` whereof The Pope recks little now. Thy city` plant Of him` that on his Maker turn'd the back` And of whose envying so much woe hath sprung` Engenders and expands the cursed flower` That hath made wander both the sheep and lambs` Turning the shepherd to a wolf. For this` The gospel and great teachers laid aside` The decretals` as their stuft margins show` Are the sole study. Pope and Cardinals` Intent on these` ne'er journey but in thought To Nazareth` where Gabriel op'd his wings. Yet it may chance` erelong` the Vatican` And other most selected parts of Rome` That were the grave of Peter's soldiery` Shall be deliver'd from the adult'rous bond.'\" }` "+ "{ \"canto\": \"X\"` \"text\": \"Looking into his first-born with the love` Which breathes from both eternal` the first Might Ineffable` whence eye or mind Can roam` hath in such order all dispos'd` As none may see and fail to enjoy. Raise` then` O reader! to the lofty wheels` with me` Thy ken directed to the point` whereat One motion strikes on th' other. There begin Thy wonder of the mighty Architect` Who loves his work so inwardly` his eye Doth ever watch it. See` how thence oblique Brancheth the circle` where the planets roll To pour their wished influence on the world; Whose path not bending thus` in heav'n above Much virtue would be lost` and here on earth` All power well nigh extinct: or` from direct Were its departure distant more or less` I' th' universal order` great defect Must` both in heav'n and here beneath` ensue. Now rest thee` reader! on thy bench` and muse Anticipative of the feast to come; So shall delight make thee not feel thy toil. Lo! I have set before thee` for thyself Feed now: the matter I indite` henceforth Demands entire my thought. Join'd with the part` Which late we told of` the great minister Of nature` that upon the world imprints The virtue of the heaven` and doles out Time for us with his beam` went circling on Along the spires` where each hour sooner comes; And I was with him` weetless of ascent` As one` who till arriv'd` weets not his coming. For Beatrice` she who passeth on So suddenly from good to better` time Counts not the act` oh then how great must needs Have been her brightness! What she was i' th' sun (Where I had enter'd)` not through change of hue` But light transparent--did I summon up Genius` art` practice--I might not so speak` It should be e'er imagin'd: yet believ'd It may be` and the sight be justly crav'd. And if our fantasy fail of such height` What marvel` since no eye above the sun Hath ever travel'd? Such are they dwell here` Fourth family of the Omnipotent Sire` Who of his spirit and of his offspring shows; And holds them still enraptur'd with the view. And thus to me Beatrice: 'Thank` oh thank` The Sun of angels` him` who by his grace To this perceptible hath lifted thee.' Never was heart in such devotion bound` And with complacency so absolute Dispos'd to render up itself to God` As mine was at those words: and so entire The love for Him` that held me` it eclips'd Beatrice in oblivion. Naught displeas'd Was she` but smil'd thereat so joyously` That of her laughing eyes the radiance brake And scatter'd my collected mind abroad. Then saw I a bright band` in liveliness Surpassing` who themselves did make the crown` And us their centre: yet more sweet in voice` Than in their visage beaming. Cinctur'd thus` Sometime Latona's daughter we behold` When the impregnate air retains the thread` That weaves her zone. In the celestial court` Whence I return` are many jewels found` So dear and beautiful` they cannot brook Transporting from that realm: and of these lights Such was the song. Who doth not prune his wing To soar up thither` let him look from thence For tidings from the dumb. When` singing thus` Those burning suns that circled round us thrice` As nearest stars around the fixed pole` Then seem'd they like to ladies` from the dance Not ceasing` but suspense` in silent pause` List'ning` till they have caught the strain anew: Suspended so they stood: and` from within` Thus heard I one` who spake: 'Since with its beam The grace` whence true love lighteth first his flame` That after doth increase by loving` shines So multiplied in thee` it leads thee up Along this ladder` down whose hallow'd steps None e'er descend` and mount them not again` Who from his phial should refuse thee wine To slake thy thirst` no less constrained were` Than water flowing not unto the sea. Thou fain wouldst hear` what plants are these` that bloom In the bright garland` which` admiring` girds This fair dame round` who strengthens thee for heav'n. I then was of the lambs` that Dominic Leads` for his saintly flock` along the way` Where well they thrive` not sworn with vanity. He` nearest on my right hand` brother was` And master to me: Albert of Cologne Is this: and of Aquinum` Thomas I. If thou of all the rest wouldst be assur'd` Let thine eye` waiting on the words I speak` In circuit journey round the blessed wreath. That next resplendence issues from the smile Of Gratian` who to either forum lent Such help` as favour wins in Paradise. The other` nearest` who adorns our quire` Was Peter` he that with the widow gave To holy church his treasure. The fifth light` Goodliest of all` is by such love inspired` That all your world craves tidings of its doom: Within` there is the lofty light` endow'd With sapience so profound` if truth be truth` That with a ken of such wide amplitude No second hath arisen. Next behold That taper's radiance` to whose view was shown` Clearliest` the nature and the ministry Angelical` while yet in flesh it dwelt. In the other little light serenely smiles That pleader for the Christian temples` he Who did provide Augustin of his lore. Now` if thy mind's eye pass from light to light` Upon my praises following` of the eighth Thy thirst is next. The saintly soul` that shows The world's deceitfulness` to all who hear him` Is` with the sight of all the good` that is` Blest there. The limbs` whence it was driven` lie Down in Cieldauro` and from martyrdom And exile came it here. Lo! further on` Where flames the arduous Spirit of Isidore` Of Bede` and Richard` more than man` erewhile` In deep discernment. Lastly this` from whom Thy look on me reverteth` was the beam Of one` whose spirit` on high musings bent` Rebuk'd the ling'ring tardiness of death. It is the eternal light of Sigebert` Who 'scap'd not envy` when of truth he argued` Reading in the straw-litter'd street.' Forthwith` As clock` that calleth up the spouse of God To win her bridegroom's love at matin's hour` Each part of other fitly drawn and urg'd` Sends out a tinkling sound` of note so sweet` Affection springs in well-disposed breast; Thus saw I move the glorious wheel` thus heard Voice answ'ring voice` so musical and soft` It can be known but where day endless shines.\" }]}";" is 61231.,45
