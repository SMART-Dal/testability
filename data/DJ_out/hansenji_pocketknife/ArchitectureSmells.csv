Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
hansenji_pocketknife,pocketknife.internal.codegen,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: pocketknife.internal.codegen; pocketknife.internal.codegen.binding
hansenji_pocketknife,pocketknife.internal.codegen,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): pocketknife.internal.codegen.binding; pocketknife.internal.codegen.builder
hansenji_pocketknife,pocketknife.internal.codegen,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [BundleFieldBinding; FieldBinding; KeySpec; IntentFieldBinding; Access]; [BundleFieldBinding.AnnotationType]; [InvalidTypeException; TypeUtil; BaseProcessor; MethodBinding; BaseGenerator]; [InvalidTypeException.Container]; [PocketKnifeProcessor]; [Access.Type]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.43
hansenji_pocketknife,pocketknife.internal.codegen.builder,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: pocketknife.internal.codegen.builder; pocketknife.internal.codegen
hansenji_pocketknife,pocketknife.internal.codegen.binding,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: pocketknife.internal.codegen.binding; pocketknife.internal.codegen
hansenji_pocketknife,com.example.pocketknife,God Component,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 43
hansenji_pocketknife,com.example.pocketknife,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature.
