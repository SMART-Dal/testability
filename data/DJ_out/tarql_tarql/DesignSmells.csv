tarql_tarql,org.deri.tarql,CSVParser,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: URLOptionsParser; CSVOptions; CSVParser; TarqlQuery; ExpandPrefixFunction; tarql; TarqlQueryExecutionFactory; TarqlQueryExecution; CSVTable; ExpandPrefixedNameFunction
tarql_tarql,org.deri.tarql,TarqlQuery,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: registered; ROWNUM; prologue; queries
tarql_tarql,org.deri.tarql,TarqlException,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
