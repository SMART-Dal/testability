Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
magarena_magarena,magic,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [CommandLineArgs; HeadlessAIGame; CardTest; MagicMain]; [CommandLineArgs.Arg]; [CommandLineArgs.Flag]; [DeckStrCal]; [CardTest.CardScenario]; [CardTest.TokenScenario]; [CardTest.BaseScenario]; [FiremindQueueWorker]; [AiStrCal]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.75
magarena_magarena,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 13.36.
