EverythingMe_plaxien,me.everything.plaxien,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: me.everything.plaxien; me.everything.plaxien.json
EverythingMe_plaxien,me.everything.plaxien,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [NodeTest; Explain; ExplainViewFactory; ExplainViewFactory.NodeHolder; Explainer; ExplainViewFactoryTest; ExplainViewFactoryTest.MockExplainer; JSONExplainBridgeTest; ExplainActivity]; [ApplicationTest]; [Explain.BaseNode]; [Explain.Node]; [Explain.ValueNode]; [Explain.Deserializer]; [ExplainViewFactory.ValueNodeHolder]; [ExplainViewFactory.ExplainViewStyle]; [ExplainViewFactory.Builder]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.53
