twitter_hpack,com.twitter.hpack.microbench,DecoderBenchmark,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
twitter_hpack,com.twitter.hpack.microbench,DecoderBenchmark,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: size; maxTableSize; maxHeaderSize; sensitive; limitToAscii; input
twitter_hpack,com.twitter.hpack.microbench,DecoderBenchmark,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AbstractMicrobenchmarkBase
