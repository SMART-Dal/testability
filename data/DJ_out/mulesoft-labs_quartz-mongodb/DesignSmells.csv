Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Design Smell,Cause of the Smell
mulesoft-labs_quartz-mongodb,com.mulesoft.quartz.mongo,MongoDBJobStore,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 64 public methods
mulesoft-labs_quartz-mongodb,com.mulesoft.quartz.mongo,SchedulerIntegrationTest,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MONGO_HOST; MONGO_PORT; MONGO_DATABASE; MONGO_USER; MONGO_PASSWORD; COUNTER; scheduler; mongo; triggerCollection; jobCollection; locksCollection; jobStore
mulesoft-labs_quartz-mongodb,com.mulesoft.quartz.mongo,SchedulerIntegrationTest.IncrementJob,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
mulesoft-labs_quartz-mongodb,com.mulesoft.quartz.mongo,SchedulerIntegrationTest.IncrementJob,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
mulesoft-labs_quartz-mongodb,com.mulesoft.quartz.mongo,MongoDBJobStoreTest,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because testJobStorage is more interested in members of the type: MongoDBJobStore
