RNCryptor_JNCryptor,org.cryptonode.jncryptor,AES256JNCryptorOutputStream.MacOutputStream,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: mac
RNCryptor_JNCryptor,org.cryptonode.jncryptor,AES256JNCryptorOutputStream.MacOutputStream,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
RNCryptor_JNCryptor,org.cryptonode.jncryptor,AES256JNCryptor,Rebellious Hierarchy,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: decryptData
RNCryptor_JNCryptor,org.cryptonode.jncryptor,InvalidHMACException,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): CryptorException
RNCryptor_JNCryptor,org.cryptonode.jncryptor,AES256v2HeaderData,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
RNCryptor_JNCryptor,org.cryptonode.jncryptor,AES256v3Ciphertext,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AES256Ciphertext
RNCryptor_JNCryptor,org.cryptonode.jncryptor,AES256JNCryptorInputStream.MacUpdateInputStream,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: mac
RNCryptor_JNCryptor,org.cryptonode.jncryptor,AES256JNCryptorInputStream.MacUpdateInputStream,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
RNCryptor_JNCryptor,org.cryptonode.jncryptor,KDFTestVectorTest,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because testKDFVector is more interested in members of the type: KDFTestVector
RNCryptor_JNCryptor,org.cryptonode.jncryptor,PasswordTestVectorTest,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because testKeyVector is more interested in members of the type: PasswordTestVector
RNCryptor_JNCryptor,org.cryptonode.jncryptor,StreamUtilsTest.SingleByteArrayInputStream,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
RNCryptor_JNCryptor,org.cryptonode.jncryptor,StreamUtilsTest.SingleByteArrayInputStream,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
RNCryptor_JNCryptor,org.cryptonode.jncryptor,AES256JNCryptorTest,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
RNCryptor_JNCryptor,org.cryptonode.jncryptor,KeyTestVectorTest,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because testKeyVector is more interested in members of the type: KeyTestVector
RNCryptor_JNCryptor,org.cryptonode.jncryptor,AES256v2CiphertextTest.ExampleData,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: ENCRYPTION_SALT; HMAC_SALT; IV; CIPHERTEXT; HMAC
RNCryptor_JNCryptor,org.cryptonode.jncryptor,AES256v2CiphertextTest.ExampleData,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
RNCryptor_JNCryptor,org.cryptonode.jncryptor,AES256v2CiphertextTest.ExampleData,Broken Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation.
