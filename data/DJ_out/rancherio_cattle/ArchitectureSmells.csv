Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
rancherio_cattle,io.cattle.platform.app,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [HzCommonConfig]; [HzCommonConfig.Basic]; [HzCommonConfig.Custom]; [ArchaiusConfig]; [AgentServerConfig]; [SystemConfig]; [ConfigConfig]; [HzLockingConfig]; [ProcessConfig]; [AppConfig]; [MetricsConfig]; [SystemServicesConfig]; [ApiServerConfig]; [ContextConfig]; [AllocatorServerConfig]; [HzEventingConfig]; [CoreModelConfig]; [TypesConfig]; [IaasApiConfig]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 1.0
rancherio_cattle,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 11.28.
