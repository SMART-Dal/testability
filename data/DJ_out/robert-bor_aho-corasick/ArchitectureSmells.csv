robert-bor_aho-corasick,org.ahocorasick.trie,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.ahocorasick.trie; org.ahocorasick.trie.handler
robert-bor_aho-corasick,org.ahocorasick.trie.handler,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.ahocorasick.trie.handler; org.ahocorasick.trie
robert-bor_aho-corasick,org.ahocorasick.trie.handler,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): org.ahocorasick.trie
robert-bor_aho-corasick,org.ahocorasick.trie.handler,Scattered Functionality,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: org.ahocorasick.interval; org.ahocorasick.trie.
robert-bor_aho-corasick,org.ahocorasick.interval,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Interval; Intervalable; IntervalNode; IntervalTree; IntervalableComparatorBySize; IntervalableComparatorByPosition; IntervalTest; IntervalTreeTest]; [IntervalNode.Direction]; [IntervalableComparatorByPositionTest]; [IntervalableComparatorBySizeTest]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.36
