robert-bor_aho-corasick,org.ahocorasick.trie,PayloadTrie,Hard-wired Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class creates objects of concrete classes and uses them. Following concrete classes are instantiated and used: org.ahocorasick.trie.TrieConfig; org.ahocorasick.interval.IntervalTree; org.ahocorasick.trie.PayloadState
robert-bor_aho-corasick,org.ahocorasick.trie,PayloadTrie,Law of Demeter violation,The tool detected the smell in this method (addKeyword) because the method voilates the law of Demeter. The long chain of method invocations is : org.ahocorasick.trie.PayloadTrie.addState; org.ahocorasick.trie.PayloadState.addEmit
