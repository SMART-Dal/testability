Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
syncany_syncany,org.syncany.util,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [FileUtil; EnvironmentUtil; LimitedDosFileAttributes; PidFileUtil; NormalizedPath; StringUtil]; [EnvironmentUtil.OperatingSystem]; [LimitedSortedSet]; [Base58]; [StringUtil.StringJoinListener]; [CollectionUtil]; [ReflectionUtil]; [SqlRunner]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.62
