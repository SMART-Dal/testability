evant_rxloader,me.tatarka.rxloader,RxLoader,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BaseRxLoader
evant_rxloader,me.tatarka.rxloader,RxLoaderBackendNestedFragment,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: RxLoaderManager; RxLoaderBackendNestedFragment
evant_rxloader,me.tatarka.rxloader,RxLoaderBackendNestedFragment.PendingPut,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required.
