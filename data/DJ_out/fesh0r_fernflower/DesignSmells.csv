fesh0r_fernflower,org.jetbrains.java.decompiler.code.cfg,ControlFlowGraph,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: last_id; blocks; first; last; exceptions; subroutines; finallyExits; jsr; range; ret
fesh0r_fernflower,org.jetbrains.java.decompiler.code.cfg,ControlFlowGraph,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e. WMC) is: 132
fesh0r_fernflower,org.jetbrains.java.decompiler.code.cfg,ControlFlowGraph.JsrRecord,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: jsr; range; ret
fesh0r_fernflower,org.jetbrains.java.decompiler.code.cfg,ControlFlowGraph.JsrRecord,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
fesh0r_fernflower,org.jetbrains.java.decompiler.code.cfg,BasicBlock,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because getLastInstruction is more interested in members of the type: InstructionSequence
fesh0r_fernflower,org.jetbrains.java.decompiler.code.cfg,BasicBlock,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: id; seq; originalOffsets; predecessors; successors; predecessorExceptions; successorExceptions; mark
fesh0r_fernflower,org.jetbrains.java.decompiler.code.cfg,BasicBlock,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 25 public methods
