Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Design Smell,Cause of the Smell
ddavison_conductor,io.ddavison.conductor,Browser,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: moniker
ddavison_conductor,io.ddavison.conductor,Platform,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
ddavison_conductor,io.ddavison.conductor,Platform.Locomotive,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
ddavison_conductor,io.ddavison.conductor,Platform.Locomotive,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: log; configuration; driver; MAX_ATTEMPTS; MAX_TIMEOUT; attempts; actions; vars; baseUrl; p; m
ddavison_conductor,io.ddavison.conductor,Platform.Locomotive,Broken Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields are declared in this class: log; configuration; driver; MAX_ATTEMPTS; MAX_TIMEOUT; attempts; actions; vars; baseUrl; p; m
ddavison_conductor,io.ddavison.conductor,LocomotiveConfig,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
ddavison_conductor,io.ddavison.conductor,Constants,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: JVM_CONDUCTOR_URL; JVM_CONDUCTOR_BROWSER; JVM_CONDUCTOR_HUB; JVM_CONDUCTOR_BASE_URL; DEFAULT_PROPERTY_URL; DEFAULT_PROPERTY_BROWSER; DEFAULT_PROPERTY_HUB; DEFAULT_PROPERTY_BASE_URL
ddavison_conductor,io.ddavison.conductor,Constants,Broken Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields are declared in this class: JVM_CONDUCTOR_URL; JVM_CONDUCTOR_BROWSER; JVM_CONDUCTOR_HUB; JVM_CONDUCTOR_BASE_URL; DEFAULT_PROPERTY_URL; DEFAULT_PROPERTY_BROWSER; DEFAULT_PROPERTY_HUB; DEFAULT_PROPERTY_BASE_URL
ddavison_conductor,io.ddavison.conductor,Conductor,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 67 methods
ddavison_conductor,io.ddavison.conductor,SuperClassTest,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
ddavison_conductor,io.ddavison.conductor,SafariTests,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
ddavison_conductor,io.ddavison.conductor,InheritedFromSuperClass,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SuperClassTest
