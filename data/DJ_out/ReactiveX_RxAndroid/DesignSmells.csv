ReactiveX_RxAndroid,io.reactivex.rxjava3.android.schedulers,HandlerScheduler.HandlerWorker,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: handler; async; disposed
ReactiveX_RxAndroid,io.reactivex.rxjava3.android.schedulers,HandlerScheduler.HandlerWorker,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
ReactiveX_RxAndroid,io.reactivex.rxjava3.android.schedulers,HandlerScheduler.ScheduledRunnable,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: handler; delegate; disposed

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
ReactiveX_RxAndroid,io.reactivex.rxjava3.android.schedulers,AndroidSchedulers.MainHolder,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: DEFAULT
ReactiveX_RxAndroid,io.reactivex.rxjava3.android.schedulers,AndroidSchedulers.MainHolder,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
ReactiveX_RxAndroid,io.reactivex.rxjava3.android.schedulers,HandlerSchedulerTest,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 58 public methods
ReactiveX_RxAndroid,io.reactivex.rxjava3.android.plugins,RxAndroidPluginsTest,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
ReactiveX_RxAndroid,io.reactivex.rxjava3.android.testutil,EmptyScheduler,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
ReactiveX_RxAndroid,io.reactivex.rxjava3.android.samples,MainActivity,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
