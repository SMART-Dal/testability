Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
kuujo_copycat,io.atomix.rest.resources,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [DistributedSemaphoreResource; PrimitiveResource; DistributedValueResource; DocumentTreeResource; DistributedCollectionResource; WorkQueueResource; AtomicMapResource; AtomicValueResource; AtomicSemaphoreResource; LeaderElectionResource; AtomicCounterResource; AtomicLockResource; DistributedLockResource; AtomicIdGeneratorResource; DistributedQueueResource; DistributedSetResource]; [AtomicMapResource.VersionedResult]; [MessagesResource]; [AtomicValueResource.CompareAndSetRequest]; [PrimitivesResource]; [PrimitivesResource.PrimitiveInfo]; [LeaderElectionResource.LeadershipResponse]; [ClusterResource]; [ClusterResource.NodeInfo]; [ClusterResource.NodeEvent]; [PrimitiveResource.PrimitiveInfo]; [EventsResource]; [StatusResource]; [DocumentTreeResource.VersionedResult]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.48
kuujo_copycat,io.atomix.rest.resources,Scattered Functionality,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: io.atomix.rest.impl; io.atomix.cluster.messaging.
