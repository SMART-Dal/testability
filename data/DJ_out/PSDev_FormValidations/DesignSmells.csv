PSDev_FormValidations,de.psdev.formvalidations.sample,SampleActivity,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
PSDev_FormValidations,de.psdev.formvalidations,FormTest,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BaseTest
PSDev_FormValidations,de.psdev.formvalidations,EditTextErrorHandlerTest,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BaseTest
PSDev_FormValidations,de.psdev.formvalidations,FieldTest,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BaseTest
PSDev_FormValidations,de.psdev.formvalidations,FormUtilsTest,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BaseTest
PSDev_FormValidations,de.psdev.formvalidations,BaseTest,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
PSDev_FormValidations,de.psdev.formvalidations.validations,IsPositiveInteger,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: POSITIVE_INT_PATTERN
