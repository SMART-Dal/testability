renepickhardt_generalized-language-modeling-toolkit,de.typology.utils,Config,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: numberOfCores; languages; splitData; buildIndex; buildGLM; buildContinuationGLM; extractContinuationGLM; buildKneserNey; buildModKneserNey; conditionalProbabilityOnly; backoffAbsolute; kneserNeySimple; kneserNeyComplex; deleteTempFiles; addSentenceTags; addFakeStartTag; decimalPlaces; inputDataSet; outputDirectory; maxCountDivider; modelLength; numberOfQueries; sampleRate; splitDataRatio; splitTestRatio; serialVersionUID; instance
renepickhardt_generalized-language-modeling-toolkit,de.typology.executables,KneserNeyBuilder,Imperative Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: main
renepickhardt_generalized-language-modeling-toolkit,de.typology.executables,MultiKneserNeyBuilder,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
renepickhardt_generalized-language-modeling-toolkit,de.typology.smoother,KneserNeySmoother,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: logger; absoluteDirectory; continuationDirectory; extractedAbsoluteDirectory; extractedContinuationDirectory; delimiter; decimalFormatter; absoluteTypeSequenceValueMap; continuationTypeSequenceValueMap; discountTypeValuesMap; discountTypesValuesMapFile; smoothComplex; totalUnigramCount
renepickhardt_generalized-language-modeling-toolkit,de.typology.smoother,ModifiedKneserNeySmoother,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): KneserNeySmoother
