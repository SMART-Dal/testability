(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
sdstoehr_har-reader,de.sstoehr.harreader.jackson,DefaultMapperFactory,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
sdstoehr_har-reader,de.sstoehr.harreader,HarReaderMode,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
sdstoehr_har-reader,de.sstoehr.harreader.model,HarEntry,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
sdstoehr_har-reader,de.sstoehr.harreader.model,HttpStatus,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: CODE_MAP; code
sdstoehr_har-reader,de.sstoehr.harreader.model,HarCookie,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
sdstoehr_har-reader,de.sstoehr.harreader.model,HarResponse,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
sdstoehr_har-reader,de.sstoehr.harreader.model,HttpMethod,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
sdstoehr_har-reader,de.sstoehr.harreader.model,HarTiming,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 20 public methods
sdstoehr_har-reader,de.sstoehr.harreader.model,HarRequest,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
sdstoehr_har-reader,de.sstoehr.harreader.model,HarCache.HarCacheInfo,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
sdstoehr_har-reader,de.sstoehr.harreader.model,HarCache.HarCacheInfo,Broken Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields are declared in this class: expires; lastAccess; eTag; hitCount; comment; additional
sdstoehr_har-reader,de.sstoehr.harreader.model,AbstractMapperTest,Wide Hierarchy,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: HarQueryParamTest; HarRequestTest; HarTest; HarCacheTest; HarEntryTest; HarContentTest; HarCookieTest; HarPostDataParamTest; HarPostDataTest; HarPageTest; HarCreatorBrowserTest; HarHeaderTest; HarResponseTest; HarPageTimingTest; HarLogTest; HarTimingTest
