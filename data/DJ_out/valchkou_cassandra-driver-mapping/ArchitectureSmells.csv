Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
valchkou_cassandra-driver-mapping,com.datastax.driver.mapping.schemasync,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: com.datastax.driver.mapping.schemasync; com.datastax.driver.mapping
valchkou_cassandra-driver-mapping,com.datastax.driver.mapping.schemasync,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): com.datastax.driver.mapping
valchkou_cassandra-driver-mapping,com.datastax.driver.mapping.schemasync,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [CreateIndex]; [DropTable]; [SyncOptions; SchemaSync; AlterTable; SyncOptionTypes; SchemaSyncTest]; [CreateTable]; [AlterTable.Instructions]; [AlterTable.Builder]; [DropIndex]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.64
