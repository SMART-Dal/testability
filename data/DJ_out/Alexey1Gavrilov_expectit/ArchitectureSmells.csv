Alexey1Gavrilov_expectit,net.sf.expectit,God Component,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 40
Alexey1Gavrilov_expectit,net.sf.expectit,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: net.sf.expectit; net.sf.expectit.matcher
Alexey1Gavrilov_expectit,net.sf.expectit,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: net.sf.expectit; net.sf.expectit.interact; net.sf.expectit.matcher
Alexey1Gavrilov_expectit,net.sf.expectit,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): net.sf.expectit.interact
Alexey1Gavrilov_expectit,net.sf.expectit,Scattered Functionality,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: net.sf.expectit.filter; net.sf.expectit.matcher.
Alexey1Gavrilov_expectit,net.sf.expectit.matcher,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: net.sf.expectit.matcher; net.sf.expectit
