Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
h2oai_h2o-dev,water.network,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: water.network; water
h2oai_h2o-dev,water.network,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: water.network; water.util; water
h2oai_h2o-dev,water.network,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: water.network; water.util; water.api; water
h2oai_h2o-dev,water.network,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: water.network; water.util; water.api; water.api.schemas3; water
h2oai_h2o-dev,water.network,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): hex.tree.gbm
h2oai_h2o-dev,water.network,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [SecurityUtils; SecurityUtilsTest]; [SecurityUtils.StoreCredentials]; [SecurityUtils.SSLCredentials]; [SSLSocketChannel; SSLSocketChannelFactoryTest; SSLProperties; SSLSocketChannelFactory; SSLPropertiesTest; SSLSocketChannelFactoryTest.ClientThread; SSLContextException]; [WrappingSecurityManager; SocketChannelFactory]; [SocketChannelUtils]; [SSLEncryptionTest]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.47
h2oai_h2o-dev,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 10.68.
