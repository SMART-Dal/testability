MinecraftForge_FernFlower,org.jetbrains.java.decompiler.code.cfg,ExceptionRangeCFG,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: InstructionSequence; Instruction; TextUtil; ClassesProcessor; StructContext; IDecompiledData; StructClass; PrimitiveConstant; ConstantPool; PooledConstant; LinkConstant; DecompilerContext; ImportCollector; StructInnerClassesAttribute; StructGeneralAttribute; VarProcessor; StructMethod; StructCodeAttribute; StructMember; AnnotationExprent; BytecodeMappingTracer; StructLineNumberTableAttribute; ExprProcessor; FlattenStatementsHelper; DirectGraph; DirectNode; Statement; StatEdge; BasicBlockStatement; BasicBlock; Exprent; MatchEngine; IMatchable; FunctionExprent; CheckTypesResult; ExitExprent; MethodWrapper; RootStatement; StructExceptionsAttribute; IfStatement; IfExprent; DecHelper; StructBootstrapMethodsAttribute; Type; StructLocalVariableTableAttribute; StructLocalVariableTypeTableAttribute; ExceptionHandler; VarVersionsProcessor; VarTypeProcessor; VarVersionPair; VarExprent; GenericMain; SSAConstructorSparseEx; SFormsFastMapDirect; AssignmentExprent; FieldExprent; StructField; BytecodeSourceMapper; LazyLoader; StructRecordAttribute; StructRecordComponent; StructPermittedSubclassesAttribute; ContextUnit; ClassWrapper; MethodProcessorRunnable; ControlFlowGraph; ExceptionRangeCFG; DataPoint; DeadCodeHelper; InstructionImpact; ExceptionDeobfuscator; StructMethodParametersAttribute; InvocationExprent; ExprUtil; StructEnclosingMethodAttribute; ClassWriter; NewExprent; InitializerProcessor; Statements; ClassReference14Processor; CatchStatement; EnumProcessor; AssertProcessor; SecondaryFunctionsHelper; ConcatenationHelper; TypeAnnotation; TypeAnnotationWriteHelper
MinecraftForge_FernFlower,org.jetbrains.java.decompiler.code.cfg,ControlFlowGraph,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: last_id; blocks; first; last; exceptions; subroutines; finallyExits; jsr; range; ret
MinecraftForge_FernFlower,org.jetbrains.java.decompiler.code.cfg,ControlFlowGraph,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e. WMC) is: 132
MinecraftForge_FernFlower,org.jetbrains.java.decompiler.code.cfg,ControlFlowGraph.JsrRecord,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: jsr; range; ret
MinecraftForge_FernFlower,org.jetbrains.java.decompiler.code.cfg,ControlFlowGraph.JsrRecord,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
MinecraftForge_FernFlower,org.jetbrains.java.decompiler.code.cfg,BasicBlock,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because getLastInstruction is more interested in members of the type: InstructionSequence
MinecraftForge_FernFlower,org.jetbrains.java.decompiler.code.cfg,BasicBlock,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: id; seq; originalOffsets; predecessors; successors; predecessorExceptions; successorExceptions; mark
MinecraftForge_FernFlower,org.jetbrains.java.decompiler.code.cfg,BasicBlock,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 25 public methods
