Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
wildfly-security_wildfly-elytron,org.wildfly.security.permission,God Component,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 52
wildfly-security_wildfly-elytron,org.wildfly.security.permission,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.wildfly.security.permission; org.wildfly.security.util; org.wildfly.security.x500.cert; org.wildfly.security.x500
wildfly-security_wildfly-elytron,org.wildfly.security.permission,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.wildfly.security.permission; org.wildfly.security.util; org.wildfly.security.x500.cert; org.wildfly.security.x500; org.wildfly.security.auth.server
wildfly-security_wildfly-elytron,org.wildfly.security.permission,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): org.wildfly.security.util
wildfly-security_wildfly-elytron,org.wildfly.security.permission,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature.
