Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
DataDog_jmxfetch,org.datadog.jmxfetch,God Component,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 41
DataDog_jmxfetch,org.datadog.jmxfetch,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.datadog.jmxfetch; org.datadog.jmxfetch.reporter
DataDog_jmxfetch,org.datadog.jmxfetch,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.datadog.jmxfetch; org.datadog.jmxfetch.tasks; org.datadog.jmxfetch.reporter
DataDog_jmxfetch,org.datadog.jmxfetch,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): org.datadog.jmxfetch.tasks
DataDog_jmxfetch,org.datadog.jmxfetch.util,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [StdoutConsoleHandler; CustomLogger; LogLevel; LogLevelTest]; [JmxfetchRmiClientSocketFactory]; [JmxfetchRmiClientSocketFactory.AsyncSocketFactory]; [MetadataHelper]; [FileHelper]; [ServiceCheckHelper; StringUtils; StringUtilsTest; ServiceCheckHelperTest]; [ByteArraySearcher]; [ByteArraySearcherTest]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.57
