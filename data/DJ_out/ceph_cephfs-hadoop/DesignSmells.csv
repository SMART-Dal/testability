Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Design Smell,Cause of the Smell
ceph_cephfs-hadoop,org.apache.hadoop.fs.ceph,CephConfigKeys,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CEPH_OBJECT_SIZE_KEY; CEPH_OBJECT_SIZE_DEFAULT; CEPH_CONF_FILE_KEY; CEPH_CONF_FILE_DEFAULT; CEPH_CONF_OPTS_KEY; CEPH_CONF_OPTS_DEFAULT; CEPH_REPLICATION_KEY; CEPH_REPLICATION_DEFAULT; CEPH_ROOT_DIR_KEY; CEPH_ROOT_DIR_DEFAULT; CEPH_LOCALIZE_READS_KEY; CEPH_LOCALIZE_READS_DEFAULT; CEPH_DATA_POOLS_KEY; CEPH_DATA_POOLS_DEFAULT; CEPH_AUTH_ID_KEY; CEPH_AUTH_ID_DEFAULT; CEPH_AUTH_KEYFILE_KEY; CEPH_AUTH_KEYFILE_DEFAULT; CEPH_AUTH_KEYRING_KEY; CEPH_AUTH_KEYRING_DEFAULT; CEPH_MON_ADDR_KEY; CEPH_MON_ADDR_DEFAULT; CEPH_PORT; CEPH_PORT_DEFAULT
ceph_cephfs-hadoop,org.apache.hadoop.fs.ceph,CephConfigKeys,Broken Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields are declared in this class: CEPH_OBJECT_SIZE_KEY; CEPH_OBJECT_SIZE_DEFAULT; CEPH_CONF_FILE_KEY; CEPH_CONF_FILE_DEFAULT; CEPH_CONF_OPTS_KEY; CEPH_CONF_OPTS_DEFAULT; CEPH_REPLICATION_KEY; CEPH_REPLICATION_DEFAULT; CEPH_ROOT_DIR_KEY; CEPH_ROOT_DIR_DEFAULT; CEPH_LOCALIZE_READS_KEY; CEPH_LOCALIZE_READS_DEFAULT; CEPH_DATA_POOLS_KEY; CEPH_DATA_POOLS_DEFAULT; CEPH_AUTH_ID_KEY; CEPH_AUTH_ID_DEFAULT; CEPH_AUTH_KEYFILE_KEY; CEPH_AUTH_KEYFILE_DEFAULT; CEPH_AUTH_KEYRING_KEY; CEPH_AUTH_KEYRING_DEFAULT; CEPH_MON_ADDR_KEY; CEPH_MON_ADDR_DEFAULT; CEPH_PORT; CEPH_PORT_DEFAULT
ceph_cephfs-hadoop,org.apache.hadoop.fs.ceph,CephTalker,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): CephFsProto
ceph_cephfs-hadoop,org.apache.hadoop.fs.ceph,CephTalker,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains large number of methods. Total methods in the class: 31 methods
ceph_cephfs-hadoop,org.apache.hadoop.fs.ceph,CephFs,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
ceph_cephfs-hadoop,org.apache.hadoop.fs.ceph,CephFileSystem,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
ceph_cephfs-hadoop,org.apache.hadoop.fs.ceph,CephFileSystem,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because getPoolReplication is more interested in members of the type: CephFsProto
ceph_cephfs-hadoop,org.apache.hadoop.fs.ceph,CephFileSystem,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
ceph_cephfs-hadoop,org.apache.hadoop.fs.contract.cephfs,TestLocalFSContractRootDirectory,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
ceph_cephfs-hadoop,org.apache.hadoop.fs.contract.cephfs,TestLocalFSContractSeek,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
ceph_cephfs-hadoop,org.apache.hadoop.fs.contract.cephfs,TestLocalFSContractCreate,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
ceph_cephfs-hadoop,org.apache.hadoop.fs.contract.cephfs,TestLocalFSContractMkdir,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
