Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Design Smell,Cause of the Smell
jetty-project_jetty-alpn,org.mortbay.jetty.alpn,AbstractALPNTest,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: context; client; server
jetty-project_jetty-alpn,org.mortbay.jetty.alpn,AbstractALPNTest,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 38 public methods
jetty-project_jetty-alpn,org.mortbay.jetty.alpn,AbstractALPNTest.SSLResult,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: context; client; server
jetty-project_jetty-alpn,org.mortbay.jetty.alpn,AbstractALPNTest.SSLResult,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
jetty-project_jetty-alpn,org.mortbay.jetty.alpn,AbstractALPNTest.SSLResult,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: context; client; server
jetty-project_jetty-alpn,org.mortbay.jetty.alpn,SSLSocketALPNTest,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
jetty-project_jetty-alpn,org.mortbay.jetty.alpn,SSLSocketALPNTest,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AbstractALPNTest
jetty-project_jetty-alpn,org.mortbay.jetty.alpn,SSLEngineALPNTest,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
jetty-project_jetty-alpn,org.mortbay.jetty.alpn,TestServer,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
jetty-project_jetty-alpn,sun.security.ssl,ServerHandshaker,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
jetty-project_jetty-alpn,sun.security.ssl,ServerHandshaker,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e. WMC) is: 269
jetty-project_jetty-alpn,sun.security.ssl,HelloExtensions,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
jetty-project_jetty-alpn,sun.security.ssl,ClientHandshaker,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
jetty-project_jetty-alpn,sun.security.ssl,ClientHandshaker,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e. WMC) is: 254
