Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Design Smell,Cause of the Smell
skroutz_elasticsearch-analysis-turkishstemmer,org.elasticsearch.index.analysis,TurkishStemmerTokenFilter,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
skroutz_elasticsearch-analysis-turkishstemmer,org.elasticsearch.index.analysis,TurkishStemmer,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: logger; ALPHABET; VOWELS; CONSONANTS; ROUNDED_VOWELS; FOLLOWING_ROUNDED_VOWELS; UNROUNDED_VOWELS; FRONT_VOWELS; BACK_VOWELS; DEFAULT_PROTECTED_WORDS_FILE; DEFAULT_VOWEL_HARMONY_EXCEPTIONS_FILE; DEFAULT_LAST_CONSONANT_EXCEPTIONS_FILE; DEFAULT_AVERAGE_STEM_SIZE_EXCEPTION_FILE; nominalVerbStates; nounStates; derivationalStates; nominalVerbSuffixes; nounSuffixes; derivationalSuffixes; AVERAGE_STEMMED_SIZE; protectedWords; vowelHarmonyExceptions; lastConsonantExceptions; averageStemSizeExceptions; DEFAULT_PROTECTED_WORDS; DEFAULT_VOWEL_HARMONY_EXCEPTIONS; DEFAULT_LAST_CONSONANT_EXCEPTIONS; DEFAULT_AVERAGE_STEM_SIZE_EXCEPTIONS
skroutz_elasticsearch-analysis-turkishstemmer,org.elasticsearch.index.analysis,TurkishStemmer,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods
skroutz_elasticsearch-analysis-turkishstemmer,org.elasticsearch.index.analysis,TurkishStemmer.DefaultSetHolder,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: DEFAULT_PROTECTED_WORDS; DEFAULT_VOWEL_HARMONY_EXCEPTIONS; DEFAULT_LAST_CONSONANT_EXCEPTIONS; DEFAULT_AVERAGE_STEM_SIZE_EXCEPTIONS

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
skroutz_elasticsearch-analysis-turkishstemmer,org.elasticsearch.index.analysis,UpdateStemmingSamples,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
skroutz_elasticsearch-analysis-turkishstemmer,org.elasticsearch.index.analysis,SimpleTurkishStemmerAnalysisTest,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
skroutz_elasticsearch-analysis-turkishstemmer,org.elasticsearch.index.analysis.stemmer.turkish.transitions,Transition,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: startState; nextState; word; suffix; marked
skroutz_elasticsearch-analysis-turkishstemmer,org.elasticsearch.index.analysis.stemmer.turkish.transitions,TransitionTest,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
skroutz_elasticsearch-analysis-turkishstemmer,org.elasticsearch.index.analysis.stemmer.turkish.states,NominalVerbState,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: initialState; finalState; suffixes
skroutz_elasticsearch-analysis-turkishstemmer,org.elasticsearch.index.analysis.stemmer.turkish.states,DerivationalState,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: initialState; finalState; suffixes
skroutz_elasticsearch-analysis-turkishstemmer,org.elasticsearch.index.analysis.stemmer.turkish.states,NounState,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: initialState; finalState; suffixes
