Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
red5_red5-websocket,org.red5.net.websocket,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.red5.net.websocket; org.red5.net.websocket.listener
red5_red5-websocket,org.red5.net.websocket,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.red5.net.websocket; org.red5.net.websocket.listener; org.red5.net.websocket.model
red5_red5-websocket,org.red5.net.websocket,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): org.red5.net.websocket.listener
red5_red5-websocket,org.red5.net.websocket,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [WebSocketScope; WebSocketScopeManager; WebSocketPlugin; WebSocketConnection; Constants; WebSocketTransport; SecureWebSocketConfiguration; WebSocketHandler; WebSocketServerTest; WebSocketServerTest.WSClient; WebSocketServerTest.DummyOutput]; [WebSocketException]; [WebSocketServerTest.Worker]; [WebSocketServerTest.WSServer]; [WebSocketServerTest.TyrusWSClient]; [WebSocketServerTest.DummyDecoder]; [WebSocketServerTest.DummyEncoder]; [WebSocketServerTest.DummySession]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.44
red5_red5-websocket,org.red5.net.websocket.model,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.red5.net.websocket.model; org.red5.net.websocket
red5_red5-websocket,org.red5.net.websocket.model,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.red5.net.websocket.model; org.red5.net.websocket; org.red5.net.websocket.listener
red5_red5-websocket,org.red5.net.websocket.model,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): org.red5.net.websocket
red5_red5-websocket,org.red5.net.websocket.model,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [WSMessage; MessageType; Packet]; [ConnectionType]; [WebSocketEvent]; [HandshakeResponse]; [HandshakeRequest]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.71
red5_red5-websocket,org.red5.net.websocket.listener,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.red5.net.websocket.listener; org.red5.net.websocket
red5_red5-websocket,org.red5.net.websocket.listener,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.red5.net.websocket.listener; org.red5.net.websocket.model; org.red5.net.websocket
red5_red5-websocket,org.red5.net.websocket.codec,Scattered Functionality,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: org.red5.net.websocket; org.red5.net.websocket.model.
