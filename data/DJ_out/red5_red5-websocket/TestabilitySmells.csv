Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Testability Smell,Cause of the Smell
red5_red5-websocket,org.red5.net.websocket,WebSocketScopeManager,Hard-wired Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class creates objects of concrete classes and uses them. Following concrete classes are instantiated and used: org.red5.net.websocket.WebSocketScope
red5_red5-websocket,org.red5.net.websocket,WebSocketConnection,Excessive Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on too many dependencies. The total number of dependencies is: 10
red5_red5-websocket,org.red5.net.websocket,Constants,Global State,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class declares global variables. The detected global variables are: MANAGER; SCOPE; CONNECTION; SESSION; WS_HANDSHAKE; WS_HEADER_KEY; WS_HEADER_VERSION; WS_HEADER_EXTENSIONS; WS_HEADER_PROTOCOL; HTTP_HEADER_HOST; HTTP_HEADER_ORIGIN; HTTP_HEADER_USERAGENT; WS_HEADER_FORWARDED; WS_HEADER_REAL_IP; WS_HEADER_GENERIC_PREFIX; URI_QS_PARAMETERS; STATUS_CLOSE_WRITTEN; WEBSOCKET_MAGIC_STRING; CRLF; END_OF_REQ; CLOSE_MESSAGE_BYTES; HANDSHAKE_COMPLETE; IDLE_COUNTER
red5_red5-websocket,org.red5.net.websocket,WebSocketServerTest,Hard-wired Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class creates objects of concrete classes and uses them. Following concrete classes are instantiated and used: org.red5.net.websocket.WebSocketPlugin
red5_red5-websocket,org.red5.net.websocket,WebSocketServerTest.WSServer,Global State,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class can be accessed as a `global` state.
red5_red5-websocket,org.red5.net.websocket.codec,WebSocketDecoder,Hard-wired Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class creates objects of concrete classes and uses them. Following concrete classes are instantiated and used: org.red5.net.websocket.WebSocketConnection; org.red5.net.websocket.model.WSMessage
red5_red5-websocket,org.red5.net.websocket.codec,WebSocketDecoder,Excessive Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on too many dependencies. The total number of dependencies is: 10
red5_red5-websocket,org.red5.net.websocket.codec,WebSocketDecoder,Law of Demeter violation,The tool detected the smell in this method (doHandShake) because the method voilates the law of Demeter. The long chain of method invocations is : org.red5.net.websocket.WebSocketScopeManager.getScope; org.red5.net.websocket.WebSocketScope.getListeners
