Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
caelum_vraptor-panettone,br.com.caelum.vraptor.panettone,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Compiler; Config; Watcher; CompiledTemplate; CompilationListener; PanettoneWalker; SimpleJavaCompiler; BytecodeCompiler; VRaptorCompiler; Main; VRaptorCompilationListener; Template; CompilerTest; TemplateTest; FileIO; CompiledTemplateTest; VRaptorCompilationListenerTest; ELEvaluator; LineNumberWalker; CodeBuilder; ReflectionHelper]; [CompilationLoadException]; [DebuggerWalker]; [CompilationException]; [CompilationIOException]; [User]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.23
