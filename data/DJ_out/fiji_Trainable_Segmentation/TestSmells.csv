fiji_Trainable_Segmentation,trainableSegmentation,FeatureStackTest,testHessian,Assertion roulette,The tool detected the smell in this test method because the test uses multiple assertion in the test. Total number of assertions in the test are: 2
fiji_Trainable_Segmentation,trainableSegmentation,BasicTest,test1,Assertion roulette,The tool detected the smell in this test method because the test uses multiple assertion in the test. Total number of assertions in the test are: 4
fiji_Trainable_Segmentation,trainableSegmentation,BasicTest,test1,Eager test,The tool detected the smell in this test method because the test checks the results of more than one method from class under test. The called methods are: trainableSegmentation.WekaSegmentation.addBinaryData; trainableSegmentation.WekaSegmentation.trainClassifier; trainableSegmentation.WekaSegmentation.getClassifiedImage
fiji_Trainable_Segmentation,trainableSegmentation,BasicTest,test1,Conditional test logic,The tool detected the smell in this test method because the test wraps the assert statements within control flow statements.
fiji_Trainable_Segmentation,trainableSegmentation,BasicTest,testDefaultFeatureGenerationST,Missing assertion,The tool detected the smell in this test method because the test doesn't have any assertion.
fiji_Trainable_Segmentation,trainableSegmentation,BasicTest,testDefaultFeatureGenerationMT,Missing assertion,The tool detected the smell in this test method because the test doesn't have any assertion.
fiji_Trainable_Segmentation,trainableSegmentation,TestGaborThreads,test,Missing assertion,The tool detected the smell in this test method because the test doesn't have any assertion.
