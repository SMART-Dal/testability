Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Design Smell,Cause of the Smell
mikvor_money-conversion,info.javaperformance.money,LongBitSet,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
mikvor_money-conversion,info.javaperformance.money,MoneyFactory,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MAX_LONG_LENGTH; MAX_ALLOWED_PRECISION; MAX_LONG_DIVIDED_BY_10; MULTIPLIERS; MULTIPLIERS_NEG; chars; offset; length; bytes; offset; length
mikvor_money-conversion,info.javaperformance.money,MoneyFactory,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MoneyLong; MoneyFactory
mikvor_money-conversion,info.javaperformance.money,MoneyFactory.CharArraySeq,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: chars; offset; length
mikvor_money-conversion,info.javaperformance.money,MoneyFactory.CharArraySeq,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
mikvor_money-conversion,info.javaperformance.money,MoneyFactory.ByteArraySeq,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: bytes; offset; length
mikvor_money-conversion,info.javaperformance.money,MoneyFactory.ByteArraySeq,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
mikvor_money-conversion,info.javaperformance.money,MoneyBigDecimal,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AbstractMoney
mikvor_money-conversion,info.javaperformance.money,AbstractMoney,Cyclic Hierarchy,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: MoneyLong
mikvor_money-conversion,info.javaperformance.money,MoneyFactoryTest,Unexploited Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: MoneyLong; MoneyBigDecimal in method testFromBd
mikvor_money-conversion,info.javaperformance.money,MoneyFactoryTest,Missing Hierarchy,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: MoneyLong; MoneyBigDecimal in method testFromBd
mikvor_money-conversion,info.javaperformance.money,MoneyTest,Unexploited Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: MoneyLong; MoneyBigDecimal in method testLongMultiply
mikvor_money-conversion,info.javaperformance.money,MoneyTest,Missing Hierarchy,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: MoneyLong; MoneyBigDecimal in method testLongMultiply
mikvor_money-conversion,info.javaperformance.money.performance,TestResult,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: name; longRate; bdRate
mikvor_money-conversion,info.javaperformance.money.performance,TestGenerator,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
