Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Design Smell,Cause of the Smell
internet-research-network_breeze,eu.icolumbo.breeze,SingletonApplicationContext,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: logger; registry
internet-research-network_breeze,eu.icolumbo.breeze,TestBean.Data,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: id; message
internet-research-network_breeze,eu.icolumbo.breeze,TestBean.Data,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
internet-research-network_breeze,eu.icolumbo.breeze,ReflectionLookupTest,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
internet-research-network_breeze,eu.icolumbo.breeze,ReflectionLookupTest.Super,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
internet-research-network_breeze,eu.icolumbo.breeze,ReflectionLookupTest.Super,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
internet-research-network_breeze,eu.icolumbo.breeze,ReflectionLookupTest.Sub,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
internet-research-network_breeze,eu.icolumbo.breeze,ReflectionLookupTest.Sub,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
internet-research-network_breeze,eu.icolumbo.breeze,ReflectionLookupTest.IntegerArithmetic,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
internet-research-network_breeze,eu.icolumbo.breeze,ReflectionLookupTest.RealArithmetic,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
internet-research-network_breeze,eu.icolumbo.breeze,ReflectionLookupTest.Arithmetic,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
internet-research-network_breeze,eu.icolumbo.breeze.build,TopologyFactoryBean,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): TopologyCompilation
internet-research-network_breeze,eu.icolumbo.breeze.build,TopologyCompilationTest,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because follow is more interested in members of the type: TopologyCompilation
internet-research-network_breeze,eu.icolumbo.breeze.build,TopologyCompilationTest,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because incomplete is more interested in members of the type: TopologyCompilation
internet-research-network_breeze,eu.icolumbo.breeze.build,TopologyCompilationTest.Bean,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
internet-research-network_breeze,eu.icolumbo.breeze.build,TopologyCompilationTest.Bean,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
internet-research-network_breeze,eu.icolumbo.breeze.namespace,TopologyBeanDefinitionParser,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
internet-research-network_breeze,eu.icolumbo.breeze.namespace,TopologyStarter,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MAIN_CONTEXT; LOCAL_RUN_PARAM; LOCAL_RUN_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT; logger; CONFIGURATION_TYPE_FIELD_SUFFIX; LIST_CONTINUATION_PATTERN; ID; properties
internet-research-network_breeze,eu.icolumbo.breeze.namespace,TopologyNamespaceHandler,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
