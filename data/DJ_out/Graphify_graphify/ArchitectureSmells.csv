Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
Graphify_graphify,org.neo4j.nlp.helpers,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.neo4j.nlp.helpers; org.neo4j.nlp.impl.cache
Graphify_graphify,org.neo4j.nlp.impl.cache,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.neo4j.nlp.impl.cache; org.neo4j.nlp.helpers
Graphify_graphify,org.neo4j.nlp.impl.cache,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): org.neo4j.nlp.helpers
Graphify_graphify,org.neo4j.nlp.impl.util,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [LearningManager; VectorUtil; VectorUtilTest; GraphManagerTest; PageRank]; [PageRankSpark]; [PageRankSpark.Sum]; [CypherUtil]; [VectorUtil.VsmCacheModel]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.56
