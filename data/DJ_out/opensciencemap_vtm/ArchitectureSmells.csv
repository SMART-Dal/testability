Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
opensciencemap_vtm,org.oscim.web.js,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [JsBitmapTileSource]; [JsMap]; [JsOsmLanduseJsonTileSource]; [JsBitmapTileLayer]; [JsVectorTileLayer]; [JsOverlays]; [JsOverlays.XLayers]; [JsOverlays.XMap]; [JsOverlays.XMapPosition]; [JsOverlays.XGenericLayer]; [JsOverlays.XTileGridLayer]; [JsOverlays.XOsmTileLayer]; [JsOverlays.XHighroadJsonTileSource]; [JsOverlays.XOSciMap4TileSource]; [JsOverlays.XLabelLayer]; [JsOverlays.XBuildingLayer]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 1.0
