Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
pydio_pydio-sync-java,io.pyd.synchro.utils,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: io.pyd.synchro.utils; io.pyd.synchro
pydio_pydio-sync-java,io.pyd.synchro.utils,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): io.pyd.synchro
pydio_pydio-sync-java,io.pyd.synchro.gui,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: io.pyd.synchro.gui; io.pyd.synchro
pydio_pydio-sync-java,io.pyd.synchro.gui,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: io.pyd.synchro.gui; io.pyd.synchro.model; io.pyd.synchro
pydio_pydio-sync-java,io.pyd.synchro.gui,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [JobEditor; LogViewer; SysTray; SWTResourceManager; AboutPanel]; [SysTray.AnimationThread]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.33
