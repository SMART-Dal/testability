Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
Flow_nbt,com.flowpowered.nbt,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: com.flowpowered.nbt; com.flowpowered.nbt.stream
Flow_nbt,com.flowpowered.nbt,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): com.flowpowered.nbt.stream
Flow_nbt,com.flowpowered.nbt.stream,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: com.flowpowered.nbt.stream; com.flowpowered.nbt
Flow_nbt,com.flowpowered.nbt.regionfile,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): com.flowpowered.nbt.stream
Flow_nbt,com.flowpowered.nbt.holder,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature.
