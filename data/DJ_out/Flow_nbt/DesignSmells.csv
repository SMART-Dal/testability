Flow_nbt,com.flowpowered.nbt,NBTUtils,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Flow_nbt,com.flowpowered.nbt,TagType,Broken Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields are declared in this class: BY_CLASS; BY_NAME; BY_ID; tagClass; typeName; id; maxId
Flow_nbt,com.flowpowered.nbt,TagType.BaseData,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: maxId
Flow_nbt,com.flowpowered.nbt,TagType.BaseData,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Flow_nbt,com.flowpowered.nbt,NBTTester,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Flow_nbt,com.flowpowered.nbt,NBTConstants,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CHARSET; TYPE_END; TYPE_BYTE; TYPE_SHORT; TYPE_INT; TYPE_LONG; TYPE_FLOAT; TYPE_DOUBLE; TYPE_BYTE_ARRAY; TYPE_STRING; TYPE_LIST; TYPE_COMPOUND; TYPE_INT_ARRAY; TYPE_SHORT_ARRAY
Flow_nbt,com.flowpowered.nbt,CompoundMap,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
Flow_nbt,com.flowpowered.nbt,Tag,Wide Hierarchy,The tool detected the smell in this class because the number of children for the class is large. This class has following sub-classes: ShortTag; EndTag; ByteTag; CompoundTag; IntTag; ByteArrayTag; FloatTag; IntArrayTag; DoubleTag; LongTag; StringTag; ShortArrayTag; ListTag
Flow_nbt,com.flowpowered.nbt.gui,NBTViewer,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Flow_nbt,com.flowpowered.nbt.gui,NBTViewer,Unexploited Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: CompoundTag; ListTag; ByteArrayTag; ShortArrayTag; IntArrayTag in method getNode
Flow_nbt,com.flowpowered.nbt.gui,NBTViewer,Missing Hierarchy,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: CompoundTag; ListTag; ByteArrayTag; ShortArrayTag; IntArrayTag in method getNode
Flow_nbt,com.flowpowered.nbt.exception,InvalidTagException,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Flow_nbt,com.flowpowered.nbt.stream,NBTOutputStream,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because writeShortArrayTagPayload is more interested in members of the type: EndianSwitchableOutputStream
Flow_nbt,com.flowpowered.nbt.stream,NBTInputStream,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because readTag is more interested in members of the type: EndianSwitchableInputStream
Flow_nbt,com.flowpowered.nbt.stream,NBTInputStream,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because readTagPayload is more interested in members of the type: EndianSwitchableInputStream
Flow_nbt,com.flowpowered.nbt.regionfile,SimpleRegionFileReader,Imperative Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: readFile
Flow_nbt,com.flowpowered.nbt.util,NBTMapper,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Flow_nbt,com.flowpowered.nbt.holder,BooleanField,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Flow_nbt,com.flowpowered.nbt.holder,BooleanField,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: INSTANCE
