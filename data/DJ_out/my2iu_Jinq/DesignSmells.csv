my2iu_Jinq,org.jinq.jpa,QueryJPAJinqStream,Unexploited Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: JPAJinqStream; QueryJinqStream in method wrap
my2iu_Jinq,org.jinq.jpa,QueryJPAJinqStream,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 36 public methods
my2iu_Jinq,org.jinq.jpa,JPAJinqStream,Rebellious Hierarchy,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: skip

my2iu_Jinq,org.jinq.jpa,JPAJinqStreamWrapper,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 54 public methods
my2iu_Jinq,org.jinq.jpa,JinqJPAWhereTest,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): JinqJPATestBase
my2iu_Jinq,org.jinq.jpa,JinqJPASelectTest,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): JinqJPATestBase
my2iu_Jinq,org.jinq.jpa,JinqJPAAggregateTest,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): JinqJPATestBase

my2iu_Jinq,org.jinq.jpa,JinqJPATypesTest.CustomerPurchases,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: name; count
my2iu_Jinq,org.jinq.jpa,JinqJPATypesTest.CustomerPurchases,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
