Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
hk2-project_hk2,org.jvnet.hk2.guice.bridge.internal,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [GuiceServiceHk2Bean; GuiceToHk2JITResolver; GuiceIntoHK2BridgeImpl; GuiceBridgeImpl; GuiceScopeContext]; [HK2ToGuiceTypeListenerImpl]; [HK2ToGuiceTypeListenerImpl.HK2FieldInjector]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.43
hk2-project_hk2,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 5.09.
