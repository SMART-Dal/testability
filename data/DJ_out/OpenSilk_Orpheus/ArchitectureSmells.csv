Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
OpenSilk_Orpheus,org.opensilk.music.playback,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.opensilk.music.playback; org.opensilk.music.playback.service
OpenSilk_Orpheus,org.opensilk.music.playback,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.opensilk.music.playback; org.opensilk.music.playback.service; org.opensilk.music.playback.renderer
OpenSilk_Orpheus,org.opensilk.music.playback,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.opensilk.music.playback; org.opensilk.music.index.client; org.opensilk.music.artwork; org.opensilk.music; org.opensilk.music.appwidgets
OpenSilk_Orpheus,org.opensilk.music.playback,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): org.opensilk.music.index.client; org.opensilk.music.playback.service; org.opensilk.music.playback.renderer
OpenSilk_Orpheus,org.opensilk.music.playback,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [MediaMetadataHelper; NotificationHelper2; NavUtils; NotificationHelperL; PlaybackStateHelper]; [PlaybackQueue; PlaybackConstants; PlaybackQueueTest4; PlaybackQueueTest2; PlaybackQueueTest3; PlaybackQueueTest; PlaybackQueueTest5]; [PlaybackQueue.QueueChangeListener]; [PlaybackQueue.Snapshot]; [PlaybackComponent; PlaybackTestApplication]; [PlaybackConstants.ACTION]; [PlaybackConstants.CMD]; [PlaybackConstants.EVENT]; [PlaybackModule]; [PlaybackQueueTestUtil]; [PlaybackTest]; [TestMediaPlayer]; [TestMediaPlayer.Factory]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.54
OpenSilk_Orpheus,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 8.4.
