Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
eXparity_hamcrest-date,org.exparity.hamcrest.date,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.exparity.hamcrest.date; org.exparity.hamcrest.date.core
eXparity_hamcrest-date,org.exparity.hamcrest.date,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): org.exparity.hamcrest.date.core
eXparity_hamcrest-date,org.exparity.hamcrest.date,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ZonedDateTimeMatchers]; [Weekdays; DateMatchers; DayMonthYear; SqlDateMatchers; Moments; Months; MonthsTest; MomentsTest]; [LocalDateMatchers]; [OffsetDateTimeMatchers]; [InstantMatchers]; [LocalTimeMatchers]; [LocalDateTimeMatchers]; [WeekDaysTest]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.53
eXparity_hamcrest-date,org.exparity.hamcrest.date,Scattered Functionality,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: org.exparity.hamcrest.date.core.types; org.exparity.hamcrest.date.core.
eXparity_hamcrest-date,org.exparity.hamcrest.date.core,God Component,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 57
eXparity_hamcrest-date,org.exparity.hamcrest.date.core,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.exparity.hamcrest.date.core; org.exparity.hamcrest.date
eXparity_hamcrest-date,org.exparity.hamcrest.date.core,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [IsYear; TemporalConverter; IsMonth; TemporalProvider; IsLeapYear; IsMinimum; IsWithin; IsMillisecond; TemporalConverters; IsSecond; IsLastDayOfMonth; IsSameDay; TemporalFunction; IsSame; TemporalMatcher; IsMinute; IsAfter; IsHour; IsMaximum; IsSameOrAfter; IsSameOrBefore; IsFirstDayOfMonth; IsWithinTest; IsSameMinuteOfHourTest; IsSameMillisecondOfSecondTest; IsSecondTest; IsMinuteTest; IsMillisecondTest; IsSameOrAfterTest; IsHourTest; IsSameOrBeforeTest; IsSameSecondOfMinuteTest; IsSameInstantTest; IsSameHourOfDayTest; IsDayOfMonth; IsBefore; TemporalProviders; IsDayOfWeek; TemporalFunctions]; [TemporalConversionException]; [IsYearTest]; [IsSameMonthOfYearTest]; [IsSameDayTest]; [IsSameYearTest]; [IsLastDayOfMonthTest]; [IsMinimumTest]; [IsSameDayOfMonthTest]; [IsMonthTest]; [IsBeforeTest]; [IsSameDayOfWeekTest]; [IsMaximumTest]; [IsAfterTest]; [IsLeapYearTest]; [IsDayOfWeekTest]; [IsFirstDayOfMonthTest]; [IsDayOfMonthTest]; [IsDayTest]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.33
eXparity_hamcrest-date,org.exparity.hamcrest.date.core.function,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [LocalDateTimeFunction]; [SqlDateFunction]; [LocalTimeFunction]; [ZonedDateTimeFunction]; [OffsetDateTimeFunction]; [InstantFunction]; [DateFunction]; [LocalDateFunction]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 1.0
eXparity_hamcrest-date,org.exparity.hamcrest.date.core.types,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [DayOfMonth]; [Hour]; [Interval]; [Minute]; [Second]; [Millisecond]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 1.0
eXparity_hamcrest-date,org.exparity.hamcrest.date.testutils,Ambiguous Interface,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component provides only a single, general entry-point via the following class: DateMatcherTestUtils
