commons-rdf_commons-rdf,org.apache.commons.rdf.api,IRI,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BlankNodeOrIRI
commons-rdf_commons-rdf,org.apache.commons.rdf.api,Literal,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): RDFTerm
commons-rdf_commons-rdf,org.apache.commons.rdf.api,BlankNode,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BlankNodeOrIRI
commons-rdf_commons-rdf,org.apache.commons.rdf.api,DefaultRDFTermFactoryTest,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
commons-rdf_commons-rdf,org.apache.commons.rdf.api,AbstractRDFTermFactoryTest,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because testCreateGraph is more interested in members of the type: RDFTermFactory
commons-rdf_commons-rdf,org.apache.commons.rdf.api,AbstractRDFTermFactoryTest,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because testCreateLiteralDateTime is more interested in members of the type: RDFTermFactory
commons-rdf_commons-rdf,org.apache.commons.rdf.api,AbstractRDFTermFactoryTest,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because testCreateLiteralString is more interested in members of the type: RDFTermFactory
commons-rdf_commons-rdf,org.apache.commons.rdf.api,AbstractRDFTermFactoryTest,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because testCreateTripleBnodeBnode is more interested in members of the type: RDFTermFactory
commons-rdf_commons-rdf,org.apache.commons.rdf.api,AbstractRDFTermFactoryTest,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because testCreateTripleBnodeIRI is more interested in members of the type: RDFTermFactory
commons-rdf_commons-rdf,org.apache.commons.rdf.api,AbstractRDFTermFactoryTest,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because testCreateTripleBnodeTriple is more interested in members of the type: RDFTermFactory
commons-rdf_commons-rdf,org.apache.commons.rdf.api,AbstractRDFTermFactoryTest,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because testInvalidTriplePredicate is more interested in members of the type: RDFTermFactory
commons-rdf_commons-rdf,org.apache.commons.rdf.api,AbstractRDFTermFactoryTest,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
commons-rdf_commons-rdf,org.apache.commons.rdf.simple,Types,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: RDF_HTML; RDF_LANGSTRING; RDF_PLAINLITERAL; RDF_XMLLITERAL; XSD_ANYURI; XSD_BASE64BINARY; XSD_BOOLEAN; XSD_BYTE; XSD_DATE; XSD_DATETIME; XSD_DAYTIMEDURATION; XSD_DECIMAL; XSD_DOUBLE; XSD_DURATION; XSD_FLOAT; XSD_GDAY; XSD_GMONTH; XSD_GMONTHDAY; XSD_GYEAR; XSD_GYEARMONTH; XSD_HEXBINARY; XSD_INT; XSD_INTEGER; XSD_LANGUAGE; XSD_LONG; XSD_NAME; XSD_NCNAME; XSD_NEGATIVEINTEGER; XSD_NMTOKEN; XSD_NONNEGATIVEINTEGER; XSD_NONPOSITIVEINTEGER; XSD_NORMALIZEDSTRING; XSD_POSITIVEINTEGER; XSD_SHORT; XSD_STRING; XSD_TIME; XSD_TOKEN; XSD_UNSIGNEDBYTE; XSD_UNSIGNEDINT; XSD_UNSIGNEDLONG; XSD_UNSIGNEDSHORT; ALL_TYPES; field
commons-rdf_commons-rdf,org.apache.commons.rdf.simple,TripleImpl,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
commons-rdf_commons-rdf,org.apache.commons.rdf.simple,TripleImpl,Unexploited Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: BlankNode; IRI; Literal; IRIImpl; LiteralImpl in method inScope
commons-rdf_commons-rdf,org.apache.commons.rdf.simple,TripleImpl,Missing Hierarchy,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: BlankNode; IRI; Literal; IRIImpl; LiteralImpl in method inScope
commons-rdf_commons-rdf,org.apache.commons.rdf.simple,LiteralImpl,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
commons-rdf_commons-rdf,org.apache.commons.rdf.simple,SimpleRDFTermFactory,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
commons-rdf_commons-rdf,org.apache.commons.rdf.simple,SimpleGraphTest,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
commons-rdf_commons-rdf,org.apache.commons.rdf.simple,SimpleNoRelativeIRIRDFTermFactoryTest,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
commons-rdf_commons-rdf,org.apache.commons.rdf.simple,DefaultGraphTest,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
commons-rdf_commons-rdf,org.apache.commons.rdf.simple,BlankNodeImplTest,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
commons-rdf_commons-rdf,org.apache.commons.rdf.simple,SimpleRDFTermFactoryTest,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
