surech_halarious,ch.halarious.core,HalBaseResource,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
surech_halarious,ch.halarious.core,HalBaseResource,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): HalResource
surech_halarious,ch.halarious.core,HalConstants,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: LINK_ROOT; EMBEDDED_ROOT
surech_halarious,ch.halarious.core,HalConstants,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: LINK_ROOT; EMBEDDED_ROOT
surech_halarious,ch.halarious.core,HalExclusionStrategy,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
surech_halarious,ch.halarious.core,HalDeserializer,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
surech_halarious,ch.halarious.core,TestReference,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): HalReference
surech_halarious,ch.halarious.core,TestChildResource,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
surech_halarious,ch.halarious.core,TestChildResource,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): HalResource
surech_halarious,ch.halarious.core,TestResource,Multifaceted Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1.0
surech_halarious,ch.halarious.core,TestResource,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): HalResource
