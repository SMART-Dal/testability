tectonicus_tectonicus,tectonicus.blockregistry,BlockVariant,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BlockState
tectonicus_tectonicus,tectonicus.blockregistry,BlockModel.BlockElement,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
tectonicus_tectonicus,tectonicus.blockregistry,BlockModel.BlockElement,Broken Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields are declared in this class: from; to; rotationOrigin; rotationAxis; rotationAngle; scaled; shaded; faces; texture; faceCulled; tinted; textureRotation
tectonicus_tectonicus,tectonicus.blockregistry,BlockModel.ElementFace,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: texture; faceCulled; tinted; textureRotation
tectonicus_tectonicus,tectonicus.blockregistry,BlockModel.ElementFace,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
tectonicus_tectonicus,tectonicus.blockregistry,BlockStateCase,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: whenClauses; modelsAndWeight
tectonicus_tectonicus,tectonicus.blockregistry,NamePropertiesPair,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: blockName; blockProperties
