Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
fcrepo3_fcrepo,org.fcrepo.server,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.fcrepo.server; org.fcrepo.server.messaging
fcrepo3_fcrepo,org.fcrepo.server,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.fcrepo.server; org.fcrepo.server.config; org.fcrepo.server.utilities
fcrepo3_fcrepo,org.fcrepo.server,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.fcrepo.server; org.fcrepo.server.config; org.fcrepo.server.utilities; org.fcrepo.server.errors
fcrepo3_fcrepo,org.fcrepo.server,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.fcrepo.server; org.fcrepo.server.config; org.fcrepo.server.utilities; org.fcrepo.server.errors; org.fcrepo.server.storage.types
fcrepo3_fcrepo,org.fcrepo.server,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): org.fcrepo.server.messaging; org.fcrepo.common; org.fcrepo.server.storage.translation; org.fcrepo.server.storage; org.fcrepo.server.utilities; org.fcrepo.server.management; org.fcrepo.server.resourceIndex; org.fcrepo.server.search; org.fcrepo.server.journal
fcrepo3_fcrepo,org.fcrepo.server,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [MockContext; Context; Server; Pluggable; ReadOnlyContext; MultiValueMap; BasicServer; Module; DatastoreConfig; ServerController; RecoveryContext; BasicServerTest; DummyServer; SpringServlet; Parameterized]; [AllUnitTests]; [AllUnitTests]; [AllIntegrationTests]; [AllOfflineTests]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.26
fcrepo3_fcrepo,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 8.19.
