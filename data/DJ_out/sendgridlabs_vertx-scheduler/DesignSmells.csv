Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Design Smell,Cause of the Smell
sendgridlabs_vertx-scheduler,com.sendgrid.labs.vertx.schedule,TimeOfWeek,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Utils; TimeOfWeek
sendgridlabs_vertx-scheduler,com.sendgrid.labs.vertx.schedule,TimeOfWeek.Day,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
sendgridlabs_vertx-scheduler,com.sendgrid.labs.vertx.schedule,TimeOfWeek.Day,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
