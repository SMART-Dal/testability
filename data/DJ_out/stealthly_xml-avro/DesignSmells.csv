Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Design Smell,Cause of the Smell
stealthly_xml-avro,ly.stealth.xmlavro,Source,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: SOURCE; DOCUMENT; WILDCARD; name; attribute
stealthly_xml-avro,ly.stealth.xmlavro,Converter,Multifaceted Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the cohesion among the methods of this class is low. LCOM of this class is: 1.0
stealthly_xml-avro,ly.stealth.xmlavro,Converter.Options,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
stealthly_xml-avro,ly.stealth.xmlavro,Converter.Options,Broken Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields are declared in this class: USAGE; xsdFile; xmlFile; avscFile; avroFile; debug; baseDir
stealthly_xml-avro,ly.stealth.xmlavro,Converter.BaseDirResolver,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: baseDir
stealthly_xml-avro,ly.stealth.xmlavro,Converter.BaseDirResolver,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
stealthly_xml-avro,ly.stealth.xmlavro,SchemaBuilder.ErrorHandler,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: exception; error
stealthly_xml-avro,ly.stealth.xmlavro,SchemaBuilder.ErrorHandler,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
stealthly_xml-avro,ly.stealth.xmlavro,SchemaBuilder.EntityResolver,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: resolver
stealthly_xml-avro,ly.stealth.xmlavro,SchemaBuilder.EntityResolver,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
stealthly_xml-avro,ly.stealth.xmlavro,SchemaBuilder.Resolver,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
stealthly_xml-avro,ly.stealth.xmlavro,ConverterTest,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
stealthly_xml-avro,ly.stealth.xmlavro.simple,Converter,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
