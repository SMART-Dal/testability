fiji_Stitching,stitching,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: stitching; stitching.model
fiji_Stitching,stitching,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): stitching.model; mpicbg.stitching.fusion
fiji_Stitching,stitching,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ImageInformation; OverlapProperties; Point2D; Point3D; CrossCorrelationResult2D; CrossCorrelationResult3D; Quicksortable]; [FloatArray2D; FloatArray; FloatArray3D; CommonFunctions]; [GridLayout]; [IntervalTest]; [ClassifiedRegionTest].
