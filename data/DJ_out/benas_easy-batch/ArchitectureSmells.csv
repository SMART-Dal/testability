Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
benas_easy-batch,org.jeasy.batch.xml,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [XmlRecordReader; XmlRecord; XmlRecordMarshaller; XmlFileRecordReader; XmlFileRecordReader.Reader; XmlFileRecordReaderTest; XmlSupportIntegrationTest; Bean; Person; XmlRecordMarshallerTest; Dependency; Website; XmlRecordReaderTest; XmlRecordMapperTest; XmlRecordMapper; Exclusion]; [MultiXmlFileRecordReader; MultiXmlFileRecordReaderTest]; [XmlRecordCompactor; XmlRecordCompactorTest]; [XmlRecordValidator; XmlRecordValidatorTest; Foo]; [XmlRecordValidator.NoOpErrorHandler]; [Dependency.Exclusions]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.24
