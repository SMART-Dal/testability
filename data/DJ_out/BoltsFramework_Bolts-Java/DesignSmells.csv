Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Design Smell,Cause of the Smell
BoltsFramework_Bolts-Java,bolts,Continuation,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Task; Continuation
BoltsFramework_Bolts-Java,bolts,Task,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 38 public methods
BoltsFramework_Bolts-Java,bolts,Task.TaskCompletionSource,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
BoltsFramework_Bolts-Java,bolts,Task.TaskCompletionSource,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
BoltsFramework_Bolts-Java,bolts,AggregateException,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
BoltsFramework_Bolts-Java,bolts,TaskTest,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 58 public methods
