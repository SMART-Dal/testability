branky_cascading.hive,cascading.hive,ORCFile,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e. WMC) is: 101
branky_cascading.hive,cascading.hive,ORCFile.Type,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
branky_cascading.hive,cascading.hive,ORCFile.Type,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
branky_cascading.hive,cascading.hive,ORCFile.OrcSchemeOutputFormat,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
branky_cascading.hive,cascading.hive,ORCFile.OrcSchemeOutputFormat,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
branky_cascading.hive,cascading.hive,RCFile,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
branky_cascading.hive,cascading.hive,HiveProps,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: HIVE_COLUMNS; HIVE_COLUMN_TYPES; HIVE_COLUMN_NUMBER; HIVE_SELECTD_COLUMN_IDS; HIVE_READ_ALL_COLUMNS
branky_cascading.hive,cascading.hive,HiveProps,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: HIVE_COLUMNS; HIVE_COLUMN_TYPES; HIVE_COLUMN_NUMBER; HIVE_SELECTD_COLUMN_IDS; HIVE_READ_ALL_COLUMNS
branky_cascading.hive,cascading.hive,HiveProps,Broken Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields are declared in this class: HIVE_COLUMNS; HIVE_COLUMN_TYPES; HIVE_COLUMN_NUMBER; HIVE_SELECTD_COLUMN_IDS; HIVE_READ_ALL_COLUMNS
branky_cascading.hive,cascading.hcatalog,HCatTap,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: IGNORE_FILE_IN_PARTITION_REGEX; LOG; db; table; filter; path; tap; identifier
branky_cascading.hive,cascading.hcatalog,HCatTap,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: HCatTap; CascadingHCatUtil
branky_cascading.hive,cascading.hcatalog,DefaultHCatScheme,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
branky_cascading.hive,cascading.hcatalog,DefaultHCatScheme,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): HCatScheme
branky_cascading.hive,org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2,SerDeUtils,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: QUOTE; COLON; COMMA; LBRACKET; RBRACKET; LBRACE; RBRACE; JSON_NULL; serdes; LOG; nativeSerDeNames; initCoreSerDes
branky_cascading.hive,cascading.functions,ConvertToHiveJavaType,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
