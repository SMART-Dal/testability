Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
LapisBlue_Pore,blue.lapis.pore.impl.event.player,God Component,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 49
LapisBlue_Pore,blue.lapis.pore.impl.event.player,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [PorePlayerUnleashEntityEvent]; [PorePlayerStatisticIncrementEvent]; [PorePlayerInteractEntityEvent]; [PorePlayerInventoryEvent]; [PorePlayerExpChangeEvent]; [PorePlayerArmorStandManipulateEvent]; [PorePlayerChangedWorldEvent]; [PorePlayerAchievementAwardedEvent]; [PorePlayerLoginEvent]; [PorePlayerKickEvent]; [PorePlayerUnregisterChannelEvent]; [PorePlayerRespawnEvent]; [PorePlayerLevelChangeEvent]; [PorePlayerEggThrowEvent]; [PorePlayerEditBookEvent]; [PorePlayerToggleSneakEvent]; [PorePlayerPreLoginEvent]; [PorePlayerBucketEmptyEvent]; [PorePlayerInteractAtEntityEvent]; [PorePlayerRegisterChannelEvent]; [PorePlayerToggleFlightEvent]; [PorePlayerFishEvent]; [PorePlayerVelocityEvent]; [PorePlayerTeleportEvent]; [PorePlayerItemHeldEvent]; [PorePlayerPortalEvent]; [PorePlayerAnimationEvent]; [PorePlayerBedLeaveEvent]; [PorePlayerShearEntityEvent]; [PorePlayerResourcePackStatusEvent]; [PorePlayerBedEnterEvent]; [PorePlayerDropItemEvent]; [PorePlayerBucketFillEvent]; [PorePlayerItemConsumeEvent]; [PorePlayerPickupItemEvent]; [PoreAsyncPlayerPreLoginEvent]; [PorePlayerToggleSprintEvent]; [PorePlayerItemBreakEvent]; [PorePlayerGameModeChangeEvent]; [PorePlayerChatEvent]; [PorePlayerChatTabCompleteEvent]; [PorePlayerQuitEvent]; [PoreAsyncPlayerChatEvent]; [PorePlayerCommandPreprocessEvent]; [PorePlayerJoinEvent]; [PorePlayerInteractEvent; PorePlayerInteractEvent.Primary; PorePlayerInteractEvent.Secondary]; [PorePlayerMoveEvent]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.96
LapisBlue_Pore,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 8.08.
