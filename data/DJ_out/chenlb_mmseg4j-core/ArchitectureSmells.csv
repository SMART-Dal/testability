Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
chenlb_mmseg4j-core,com.chenlb.mmseg4j,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: com.chenlb.mmseg4j; com.chenlb.mmseg4j.rule
chenlb_mmseg4j-core,com.chenlb.mmseg4j,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): com.chenlb.mmseg4j.rule; com.chenlb.mmseg4j.example
chenlb_mmseg4j-core,com.chenlb.mmseg4j,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature.
