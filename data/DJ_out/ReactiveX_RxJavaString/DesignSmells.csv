ReactiveX_RxJavaString,rx.internal.operators,ObservableSplit,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
ReactiveX_RxJavaString,rx.internal.operators,ObservableSplit.SplitSubscriber,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
ReactiveX_RxJavaString,rx.internal.operators,ObservableSplit.SplitSubscriber,Broken Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields are declared in this class: actual; pattern; requested; wip; limit; queue; current; leftOver; index; produced; empty; done; error; cancelled; serialVersionUID
ReactiveX_RxJavaString,rx.internal.operators,ObservableSplit.Requested,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: serialVersionUID
