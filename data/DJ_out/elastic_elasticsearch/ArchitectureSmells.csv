Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
elastic_elasticsearch,org.elasticsearch.smoketest,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [SmokeTestPluginsClientYamlTestSuiteIT]; [SmokeTestIngestWithAllDepsClientYamlTestSuiteIT]; [SmokeTestMultiNodeClientYamlTestSuiteIT]; [SmokeTestIngestDisabledClientYamlTestSuiteIT]; [DocsClientYamlTestSuiteIT]; [DocsClientYamlTestSuiteIT.CompareAnalyzers]; [XSmokeTestPluginsClientYamlTestSuiteIT]; [WatcherSlackYamlTestSuiteIT]; [WatcherJiraYamlTestSuiteIT]; [WatcherPagerDutyYamlTestSuiteIT]; [SmokeTestSecurityWithMustacheClientYamlTestSuiteIT]; [SmokeTestMonitoringWithSecurityIT]; [SmokeTestMonitoringWithSecurityIT.TestRestHighLevelClient]; [SmokeTestPluginsSslClientYamlTestSuiteIT]; [TextStructureWithSecurityIT; TextStructureWithSecurityInsufficientRoleIT]; [MlWithSecurityInsufficientRoleIT; MlWithSecurityIT; MlWithSecurityUserRoleIT]; [MonitoringWithWatcherRestIT]; [SmokeTestWatcherTestSuiteIT]; [WatcherYamlRestIT]; [SmokeTestWatcherWithSecurityIT]; [SmokeTestWatcherWithSecurityClientYamlTestSuiteIT]; [GraphWithSecurityInsufficientRoleIT; GraphWithSecurityIT]; [XDocsClientYamlTestSuiteIT]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.85
elastic_elasticsearch,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves.
