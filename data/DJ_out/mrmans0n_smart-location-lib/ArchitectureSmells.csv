Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
mrmans0n_smart-location-lib,io.nlopez.smartlocation.activity,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: io.nlopez.smartlocation.activity; io.nlopez.smartlocation
mrmans0n_smart-location-lib,io.nlopez.smartlocation.utils,Ambiguous Interface,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component provides only a single, general entry-point via the following class: LoggerFactory
mrmans0n_smart-location-lib,io.nlopez.smartlocation.utils,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Logger; LoggerFactory; LoggerFactory.Sssht; LoggerFactory.Blabber]; [GooglePlayServicesListener]; [ServiceConnectionListener]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.5
mrmans0n_smart-location-lib,io.nlopez.smartlocation,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: io.nlopez.smartlocation; io.nlopez.smartlocation.location
mrmans0n_smart-location-lib,io.nlopez.smartlocation,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): io.nlopez.smartlocation.location; io.nlopez.smartlocation.geocoding; io.nlopez.smartlocation.activity; io.nlopez.smartlocation.geofencing; io.nlopez.smartlocation.util
