holodeck-b2b_Holodeck-B2B,org.holodeckb2b.ebms3.security,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): org.holodeckb2b.ebms3.security.util
holodeck-b2b_Holodeck-B2B,org.holodeckb2b.ebms3.security,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [SignatureProcessor; SecurityHeaderProcessor; SecurityConstants; SecurityHeaderCreator; Action]; [DefaultSecurityAlgorithms]; [DefaultProvider]; [SignatureTrustValidator]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.5
holodeck-b2b_Holodeck-B2B,org.holodeckb2b.ebms3.security,Scattered Functionality,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: org.holodeckb2b.interfaces.messagemodel; org.holodeckb2b.interfaces.pmode.
holodeck-b2b_Holodeck-B2B,org.holodeckb2b.ebms3.security,Scattered Functionality,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: org.holodeckb2b.interfaces.core; org.holodeckb2b.interfaces.security.trust.
holodeck-b2b_Holodeck-B2B,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves.
