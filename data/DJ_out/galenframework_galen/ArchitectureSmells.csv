Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
galenframework_galen,com.galenframework.rainbow4j,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: com.galenframework.rainbow4j; com.galenframework.rainbow4j.filters
galenframework_galen,com.galenframework.rainbow4j,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): com.galenframework.rainbow4j.filters
galenframework_galen,com.galenframework.rainbow4j,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ComparisonOptions; Rainbow4J; ImageCompareResult; ImageHandler; Spectrum]; [BufferUtils]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.33
galenframework_galen,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 8.46.
