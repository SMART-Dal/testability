jurmous_etcd4j,mousio.etcd4j.transport,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: mousio.etcd4j.transport; mousio.etcd4j
jurmous_etcd4j,mousio.etcd4j.transport,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: mousio.etcd4j.transport; mousio.etcd4j; mousio.etcd4j.requests
jurmous_etcd4j,mousio.etcd4j.transport,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): mousio.etcd4j; mousio.etcd4j.requests; mousio.etcd4j.promises
jurmous_etcd4j,mousio.etcd4j.transport,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature.
