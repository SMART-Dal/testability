pilehvar_ADW,it.uniroma1.lcl.adw,LexicalItemType,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
pilehvar_ADW,it.uniroma1.lcl.adw,LexicalItemType,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
pilehvar_ADW,it.uniroma1.lcl.adw,ItemType,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
pilehvar_ADW,it.uniroma1.lcl.adw,DisambiguationMethod,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
pilehvar_ADW,it.uniroma1.lcl.adw.utils,SemSigUtils,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SemSig; SemSigUtils
pilehvar_ADW,it.uniroma1.lcl.adw.utils,Index,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: key; value
pilehvar_ADW,it.uniroma1.lcl.adw.utils,GeneralUtils,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: GeneralUtils; WordNetUtils
pilehvar_ADW,it.uniroma1.lcl.adw.utils,StanfordTokenizer.PennTokenizer,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: stringSubs; oldChars
pilehvar_ADW,it.uniroma1.lcl.adw.utils,StanfordTokenizer.PennTokenizer,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
pilehvar_ADW,it.uniroma1.lcl.adw.semsig,SemSig,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SemSig; SemSigUtils
pilehvar_ADW,it.uniroma1.lcl.adw.semsig,SemSigProcess,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
pilehvar_ADW,it.uniroma1.lcl.adw.semsig,LKB,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
pilehvar_ADW,it.uniroma1.lcl.adw.comparison,Jaccard,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
pilehvar_ADW,it.uniroma1.lcl.adw.comparison,KLDivergence,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
pilehvar_ADW,it.uniroma1.lcl.adw.comparison,JensenShannon,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
pilehvar_ADW,it.uniroma1.lcl.adw.comparison,Cosine,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
