jodastephen_property-alliance,org.joda.pa,MetaBean,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: MetaProperty; MetaBean; BeanBuilder
jodastephen_property-alliance,org.joda.pa,Bean,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
jodastephen_property-alliance,org.joda.pa,FunctionalMetaProperty,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
jodastephen_property-alliance,org.joda.pa,FunctionalMetaProperty,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AbstractMetaProperty
jodastephen_property-alliance,org.joda.pa,MethodMetaProperty,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
jodastephen_property-alliance,org.joda.pa,MethodMetaProperty,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AbstractMetaProperty
jodastephen_property-alliance,org.joda.pa,MethodMetaProperty.MethodPurpose,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class:
