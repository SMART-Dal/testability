Baqend_Orestes-Bloomfilter,orestes.bloomfilter,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: orestes.bloomfilter; orestes.bloomfilter.redis.helper
Baqend_Orestes-Bloomfilter,orestes.bloomfilter,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): orestes.bloomfilter.redis.helper
Baqend_Orestes-Bloomfilter,orestes.bloomfilter,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature.
