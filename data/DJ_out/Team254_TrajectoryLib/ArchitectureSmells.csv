Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
Team254_TrajectoryLib,com.team254.lib.trajectory,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: com.team254.lib.trajectory; com.team254.lib.trajectory.io
Team254_TrajectoryLib,com.team254.lib.trajectory,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): com.team254.lib.trajectory.io
Team254_TrajectoryLib,com.team254.lib.trajectory,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Trajectory; Trajectory.Pair; TrajectoryFollower; Path; PathGenerator; Spline; Main; TrajectoryGenerator; TrajectoryGeneratorTest; PathGeneratorTest; SplineTest; WaypointSequence]; [Trajectory.Segment]; [WaypointSequence.Waypoint]; [Spline.Type]; [TrajectoryGenerator.Config]; [TrajectoryGenerator.Strategy]; [TrajectoryGenerator.IntegrationMethod]; [TrajectoryLibTestSuite]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.42
Team254_TrajectoryLib,com.team254.lib.trajectory.io,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: com.team254.lib.trajectory.io; com.team254.lib.trajectory
