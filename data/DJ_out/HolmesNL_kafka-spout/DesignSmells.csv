HolmesNL_kafka-spout,nl.minvenj.nfi.storm.kafka.fail,UnreliableFailHandler,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: IDENTIFIER
HolmesNL_kafka-spout,nl.minvenj.nfi.storm.kafka.fail,ReliableFailHandler,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: IDENTIFIER
HolmesNL_kafka-spout,nl.minvenj.nfi.storm.kafka.fail,AbstractFailHandler,Rebellious Hierarchy,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: shouldReplay
HolmesNL_kafka-spout,nl.minvenj.nfi.storm.kafka.util,ConfigUtils,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CONFIG_PREFIX; CONFIG_FILE; CONFIG_TOPIC; DEFAULT_TOPIC; CONFIG_FAIL_HANDLER; DEFAULT_FAIL_HANDLER; CONFIG_GROUP; DEFAULT_GROUP; CONFIG_BUFFER_MAX_MESSAGES; DEFAULT_BUFFER_MAX_MESSAGES; LOG
HolmesNL_kafka-spout,nl.minvenj.nfi.storm.kafka.util,ConfigUtilsTest,Unexploited Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: ReliableFailHandler; UnreliableFailHandler; FailHandler in method testCreateFailHandlerFromString
HolmesNL_kafka-spout,nl.minvenj.nfi.storm.kafka.util,ConfigUtilsTest,Missing Hierarchy,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: ReliableFailHandler; UnreliableFailHandler; FailHandler in method testCreateFailHandlerFromString
HolmesNL_kafka-spout,nl.minvenj.nfi.storm.kafka.util,ConfigUtilsTest.TestFailHandler,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
HolmesNL_kafka-spout,nl.minvenj.nfi.storm.kafka.util,ConfigUtilsTest.TestFailHandler,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
