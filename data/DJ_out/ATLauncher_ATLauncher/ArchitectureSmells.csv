Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
ATLauncher_ATLauncher,com.atlauncher,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: com.atlauncher; com.atlauncher.data
ATLauncher_ATLauncher,com.atlauncher,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: com.atlauncher; com.atlauncher.data; com.atlauncher.utils
ATLauncher_ATLauncher,com.atlauncher,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: com.atlauncher; com.atlauncher.data; com.atlauncher.utils; com.atlauncher.data.minecraft
ATLauncher_ATLauncher,com.atlauncher,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): com.atlauncher.data; com.atlauncher.utils; io.github.asyncronous.toast; com.atlauncher.gui; com.atlauncher.themes; com.atlauncher.gui.tabs; com.atlauncher.gui.tabs.news; com.atlauncher.gui.dialogs
ATLauncher_ATLauncher,com.atlauncher,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature.
