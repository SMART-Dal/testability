theupswell_appengine-counter,io.instacount.appengine.counter.service,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: io.instacount.appengine.counter.service; io.instacount.appengine.counter
theupswell_appengine-counter,io.instacount.appengine.counter.service,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency.
