Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Design Smell,Cause of the Smell
prasanthj_hyperloglog,com.github.prasanthj.hll,HyperLogLogUtils,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MAGIC
prasanthj_hyperloglog,com.github.prasanthj.hll,HLLConstants,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MIN_P_VALUE; MAX_P_VALUE; TEMP_LIST_DEFAULT_SIZE; P_PRIME_VALUE; Q_PRIME_VALUE; K_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR; thresholdData; rawEstimateData; biasData; inversePow2Data
prasanthj_hyperloglog,com.github.prasanthj.hll,HLLConstants,Broken Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields are declared in this class: MIN_P_VALUE; MAX_P_VALUE; TEMP_LIST_DEFAULT_SIZE; P_PRIME_VALUE; Q_PRIME_VALUE; K_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR; thresholdData; rawEstimateData; biasData; inversePow2Data
prasanthj_hyperloglog,com.github.prasanthj.hll,HyperLogLog,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 29 public methods
prasanthj_hyperloglog,com.github.prasanthj.hll,HyperLogLog.EncodingType,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
prasanthj_hyperloglog,com.github.prasanthj.hll,HyperLogLog.EncodingType,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
prasanthj_hyperloglog,com.github.prasanthj.hll,HyperLogLog.HyperLogLogBuilder,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: numRegisterIndexBits; encoding; bitPacking; noBias
prasanthj_hyperloglog,com.github.prasanthj.hll,HyperLogLog.HyperLogLogBuilder,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
prasanthj_hyperloglog,com.github.prasanthj.hll,TestHLLSerialization,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: size; testFile; pathPrefix; SEED; longRangeTolerance; shortRangeTolerance; testCaseName
prasanthj_hyperloglog,com.github.prasanthj.hll.tools,HyperLogLogCLI,Imperative Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: main
prasanthj_hyperloglog,com.github.prasanthj.hll.tools,HyperLogLogCLI,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
prasanthj_hyperloglog,com.github.prasanthj.hyperloglog,HyperLogLogAdd,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
