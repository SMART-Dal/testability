Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Design Smell,Cause of the Smell
seagate_kinetic-java,com.seagate.kinetic.heartbeat,HeartbeatMessage,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
seagate_kinetic-java,com.seagate.kinetic.common.protocol.codec,KineticDecoder,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
seagate_kinetic-java,com.seagate.kinetic.common.protocol.codec,KineticEncoder,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
seagate_kinetic-java,com.seagate.kinetic.common.lib,TlsUtil,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: logger; SUPPORTED_TLS_PROTOCOLS; supportedTLSString
seagate_kinetic-java,com.seagate.kinetic.common.lib,Hmac.HmacException,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: serialVersionUID; status
seagate_kinetic-java,com.seagate.kinetic.common.lib,Hmac.HmacException,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
