Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
xtreemfs_xtreemfs,org.xtreemfs.foundation.flease.proposer,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.xtreemfs.foundation.flease.proposer; org.xtreemfs.foundation.flease
xtreemfs_xtreemfs,org.xtreemfs.foundation.flease.proposer,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.xtreemfs.foundation.flease.proposer; org.xtreemfs.foundation.flease.acceptor; org.xtreemfs.foundation.flease
xtreemfs_xtreemfs,org.xtreemfs.foundation.flease.proposer,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): org.xtreemfs.foundation.flease.acceptor
xtreemfs_xtreemfs,org.xtreemfs.foundation.flease.proposer,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [FleaseListener]; [FleaseProposer; FleaseProposerCell; FleaseLocalQueueInterface; FleaseException; FleaseProposerTest]; [FleaseProposerCell.State]; [CellAction]; [CellAction.ActionName]; [CellAction.CellActionList]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.6
xtreemfs_xtreemfs,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 13.38.
