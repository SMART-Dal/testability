lestard_advanced-bindings,eu.lestard.advanced_bindings.api,SwitchBindings.SwitchBuilder,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: baseObservable; valueMap; defaultValue
lestard_advanced-bindings,eu.lestard.advanced_bindings.api,SwitchBindings.SwitchBuilder,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
lestard_advanced-bindings,eu.lestard.advanced_bindings.api,MathBindings,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
