Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
btrplace_scheduler,org.btrplace.btrpsl.constraint,God Component,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 58
btrplace_scheduler,org.btrplace.btrpsl.constraint,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.btrplace.btrpsl.constraint; org.btrplace.btrpsl.tree
btrplace_scheduler,org.btrplace.btrpsl.constraint,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.btrplace.btrpsl.constraint; org.btrplace.btrpsl.tree; org.btrplace.btrpsl
btrplace_scheduler,org.btrplace.btrpsl.constraint,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [LonelyBuilder; DefaultSatConstraintBuilder; ReadyBuilder; BanBuilder; AmongBuilder; KilledBuilder; SleepingBuilder; OfflineBuilder; PreserveBuilder; NoDelayBuilder; SplitAmongBuilder; GatherBuilder; ResourceCapacityBuilder; SatConstraintBuilder; ConstraintParam; DefaultConstraintsCatalog; ListOfParam; NumberParam; StringParam; OneOfParam; ConstraintsCatalog; MaxOnlineBuilder; SplitBuilder; DefaultConstraintParam; SeqBuilder; RunningCapacityBuilder; OnlineBuilder; FenceBuilder; SpreadBuilder; OverbookBuilder; RootBuilder; QuarantineBuilder; RunningBuilder]; [ConstraintBuilderException]; [RunningCapacityBuilderTest]; [SplitBuilderTest]; [OfflineBuilderTest]; [SleepingBuilderTest]; [KilledBuilderTest]; [BanBuilderTest]; [ReadyBuilderTest]; [OverbookBuilderTest]; [OnlineBuilderTest]; [RootBuilderTest]; [MockBtrPlaceTree]; [MockBtrPlaceTree.MockToken]; [QuarantineBuilderTest]; [ResourceCapacityBuilderTest]; [FenceBuilderTest]; [PreserveBuilderTest]; [SpreadBuilderTest]; [MaxOnlineBuilderTest]; [SeqBuilderTest]; [GatherBuilderTest]; [RunningBuilderTest]; [AmongBuilderTest]; [SplitAmongBuilderTest]; [LonelyBuilderTest]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.45
btrplace_scheduler,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 9.56.
