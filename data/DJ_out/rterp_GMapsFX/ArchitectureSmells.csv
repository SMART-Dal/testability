Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
rterp_GMapsFX,com.dlsc.gmapsfx.shapes,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: com.dlsc.gmapsfx.shapes; com.dlsc.gmapsfx.javascript.object
rterp_GMapsFX,com.dlsc.gmapsfx.javascript.event,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: com.dlsc.gmapsfx.javascript.event; com.dlsc.gmapsfx.javascript.object
rterp_GMapsFX,com.dlsc.gmapsfx.javascript.event,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): com.dlsc.gmapsfx.javascript.object
rterp_GMapsFX,com.dlsc.gmapsfx.javascript.event,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [StateEventHandler; GFXEventHandler; EventHandlers; GMapMouseEvent; MouseEventHandler; UIEventHandler]; [UIEventType]; [MapStateEventType]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.38
