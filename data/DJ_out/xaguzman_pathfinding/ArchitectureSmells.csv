Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
xaguzman_pathfinding,org.xguzm.pathfinding,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [BHeap; BHeapNode; NavigationNode; PathFinderOptions; Heuristic; NavigationGraph; Util; PathFinder]; [PathFindingException]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.22
xaguzman_pathfinding,org.xguzm.pathfinding.grid,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.xguzm.pathfinding.grid; org.xguzm.pathfinding.grid.finders
xaguzman_pathfinding,org.xguzm.pathfinding.grid,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): org.xguzm.pathfinding.grid.finders
xaguzman_pathfinding,org.xguzm.pathfinding.grid.finders,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.xguzm.pathfinding.grid.finders; org.xguzm.pathfinding.grid
xaguzman_pathfinding,org.xguzm.pathfinding.util,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature.
