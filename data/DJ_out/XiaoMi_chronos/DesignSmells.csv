Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Design Smell,Cause of the Smell
XiaoMi_chronos,com.xiaomi.infra.chronos,ChronosImplement,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ChronosImplement; ChronosServer
XiaoMi_chronos,com.xiaomi.infra.chronos,ChronosServer,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: LOG; CLUSTER_NAME; MAX_THREAD; ZK_ADVANCE_TIMESTAMP; SOCKET_TIMEOUT; MESSAGE_LENGTH_LIMIT; properties; chronosServerWatcher; chronosImplement; thriftServer
XiaoMi_chronos,com.xiaomi.infra.chronos.exception,FatalChronosException,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
XiaoMi_chronos,com.xiaomi.infra.chronos.exception,FatalChronosException,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ChronosException
XiaoMi_chronos,com.xiaomi.infra.chronos.benchmark,BenchmarkChronosServer,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
XiaoMi_chronos,com.xiaomi.infra.chronos.zookeeper,FailoverWatcher,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: FailoverWatcher; FailoverServer; ZooKeeperUtil
XiaoMi_chronos,com.xiaomi.infra.chronos.zookeeper,FailoverServer,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: LOG; BASE_ZNODE; ZK_QUORUM; SESSION_TIMEOUT; CONNECT_RETRY_TIMES; ZK_SECURE; ZK_ADMIN; JAAS_FILE; KRB5_FILE; SERVER_HOST; SERVER_PORT; failoverWatcher
XiaoMi_chronos,com.xiaomi.infra.chronos.zookeeper,TestFailoverServer.TestableFailoverServer,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: LOG; isRunning
XiaoMi_chronos,com.xiaomi.infra.chronos.zookeeper,TestFailoverServer.TestableFailoverServer,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
XiaoMi_chronos,com.xiaomi.infra.chronos.client,ChronosClientWatcher,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ChronosClientWatcher; ChronosClient
XiaoMi_chronos,com.xiaomi.infra.chronos.client,ChronosClient,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: ZK_QUORUM; CLUSTER_NAME; SESSION_TIMEOUT; CONNECT_RETRY_TIMES; SOCKET_TIMEOUT; chronosClientWatcher
