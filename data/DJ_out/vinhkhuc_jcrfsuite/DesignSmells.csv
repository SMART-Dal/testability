vinhkhuc_jcrfsuite,com.github.jcrfsuite.util,CrfSuiteLoader,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CRFSUITE_SYSTEM_PROPERTIES_FILE; KEY_CRFSUITE_LIB_PATH; KEY_CRFSUITE_LIB_NAME; KEY_CRFSUITE_TEMPDIR; KEY_CRFSUITE_USE_SYSTEMLIB; KEY_CRFSUITE_DISABLE_BUNDLED_LIBS; isLoaded
vinhkhuc_jcrfsuite,com.github.jcrfsuite.util,Pair,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: first; second
vinhkhuc_jcrfsuite,com.github.jcrfsuite,CrfTagger,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because tag is more interested in members of the type: Tagger
vinhkhuc_jcrfsuite,com.github.jcrfsuite,CrfTrainer,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: DEFAULT_ALGORITHM; DEFAULT_GRAPHICAL_MODEL_TYPE; DEFAULT_ENCODING
vinhkhuc_jcrfsuite,third_party.org.chokkan.crfsuite,Trainer,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Attribute; crfsuiteJNI; Item; ItemSequence; StringList; Trainer; Tagger
vinhkhuc_jcrfsuite,third_party.org.chokkan.crfsuite,crfsuite,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
vinhkhuc_jcrfsuite,third_party.org.chokkan.crfsuite,crfsuiteJNI,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 67 public methods
