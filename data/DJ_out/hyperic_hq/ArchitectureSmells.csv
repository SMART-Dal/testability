Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
hyperic_hq,org.hyperic.lather,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [LatherValue; NullLatherValue; LatherRemoteException; LatherDump]; [LatherKeyNotFoundException]; [LatherContext]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.5
hyperic_hq,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 11.45.
