Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Design Smell,Cause of the Smell
cathive_sass-java,com.cathive.sass,SassOutputStyle,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: intValue
cathive_sass-java,com.cathive.sass,SassSeparator,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: intValue
cathive_sass-java,com.cathive.sass,SassSeparator,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
cathive_sass-java,com.cathive.sass,SassTask,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
cathive_sass-java,com.cathive.sass,SassTag,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: intValue

cathive_sass-java,com.cathive.sass,SassContext,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SassContext; SassOptions
cathive_sass-java,com.cathive.sass,SassOptions,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 35 public methods
