bedrin_jdbc-sniffer,io.sniffy.log,OneTimePolyglogImpl,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
bedrin_jdbc-sniffer,io.sniffy.log,PolyglogSystemOutImpl,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
bedrin_jdbc-sniffer,io.sniffy.log,PolyglogFactory,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
bedrin_jdbc-sniffer,io.sniffy.nio.compat,SniffyCompatSelectorProviderModule,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
bedrin_jdbc-sniffer,io.sniffy.nio.compat,SniffyAsynchronousChannelProvider,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
bedrin_jdbc-sniffer,io.sniffy.nio.compat,SniffyCompatSelectorProviderModule,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
bedrin_jdbc-sniffer,io.sniffy.nio.compat,SniffyAsynchronousSocketChannel,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
