Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
Crate_crate,io.crate.lucene,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: io.crate.lucene; io.crate.execution.engine.collect
Crate_crate,io.crate.lucene,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: io.crate.lucene; io.crate.expression.symbol; io.crate.expression.scalar
Crate_crate,io.crate.lucene,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: io.crate.lucene; io.crate.expression.symbol; io.crate.analyze.relations; io.crate.expression.operator
Crate_crate,io.crate.lucene,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: io.crate.lucene; io.crate.expression.symbol; io.crate.analyze.relations; io.crate.metadata; io.crate.testing
Crate_crate,io.crate.lucene,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): io.crate.execution.engine.collect; io.crate.lucene.match
Crate_crate,io.crate.lucene,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [GenericFunctionQuery; WithinQueryBuilderTest; LuceneQueryBuilderTest; LikeQueryBuilderTest; CommonQueryBuilderTest; ArrayLengthQueryBuilderTest; ThreeValuedLogicQueryBuilderTest]; [GenericFunctionQuery.FilteredTwoPhaseIterator]; [FunctionToQuery; LuceneQueryBuilder]; [FunctionLiteralPair]; [ArrayMapperService]; [FieldTypeLookup]; [LuceneQueryBuilder.Context]; [LuceneQueryBuilder.Visitor]; [BitStringQueryTest]; [ArrayLengthQueryTest]; [GenericFunctionQueryTest]; [CIDRRangeQueryTest]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.63
Crate_crate,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 26.06.
