Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
flexiblepower_powermatcher,net.powermatcher.examples,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Freezer]; [Freezer.Config]; [ObjectiveAgent]; [ObjectiveAgent.Config]; [ConsoleObserver]; [ConsoleObserver.Config]; [PVPanelAgent]; [PVPanelAgent.Config]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 1.0
flexiblepower_powermatcher,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 6.38.
