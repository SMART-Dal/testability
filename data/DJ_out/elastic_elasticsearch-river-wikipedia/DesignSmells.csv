elastic_elasticsearch-river-wikipedia,org.elasticsearch.river.wikipedia,WikipediaRiver.Parser,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: parser
elastic_elasticsearch-river-wikipedia,org.elasticsearch.river.wikipedia,WikipediaRiver.Parser,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
