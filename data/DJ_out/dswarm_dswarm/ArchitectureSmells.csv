Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
dswarm_dswarm,org.dswarm.init,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ConfigModule; LoggingConfigurator; LoggingAppender]; [ConfigModule.ConfigFactoryWithOffloading]; [ExecutionScopeStore]; [DMPException]; [LoggingAppender.Builder]; [ExecutionScope]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.75
dswarm_dswarm,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 7.87.
