MicBrain_Graph-API,graph,LabeledGraph,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
MicBrain_Graph-API,graph,GraphObjTesting,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 55 public methods
