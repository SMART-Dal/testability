Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
bkimminich_kata-tcg,de.kimminich.kata.tcg,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: de.kimminich.kata.tcg; de.kimminich.kata.tcg.strategy
bkimminich_kata-tcg,de.kimminich.kata.tcg,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): de.kimminich.kata.tcg.strategy
bkimminich_kata-tcg,de.kimminich.kata.tcg.strategy,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: de.kimminich.kata.tcg.strategy; de.kimminich.kata.tcg
bkimminich_kata-tcg,de.kimminich.kata.tcg.strategy,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature.
