Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
dashbuilder_dashbuilder,org.dashbuilder.renderer.google.client,God Component,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 41
dashbuilder_dashbuilder,org.dashbuilder.renderer.google.client,Scattered Functionality,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: org.dashbuilder.displayer; org.dashbuilder.displayer.client.
dashbuilder_dashbuilder,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves.
