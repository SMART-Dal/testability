Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
JeffreyFalgout_ThrowingStream,name.falgout.jeffrey.throwing.stream,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: name.falgout.jeffrey.throwing.stream; name.falgout.jeffrey.throwing.stream.adapter
JeffreyFalgout_ThrowingStream,name.falgout.jeffrey.throwing.stream,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): name.falgout.jeffrey.throwing.stream.adapter
JeffreyFalgout_ThrowingStream,name.falgout.jeffrey.throwing.stream,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature.
