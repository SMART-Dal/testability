Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
LapisBlue_Commons,blue.lapis.common.command,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: blue.lapis.common.command; blue.lapis.common.command.impl
LapisBlue_Commons,blue.lapis.common.command,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [LapisCommand; CommandInvocationTarget; CommandRecognizer; Tokenizer; CommandHolder; CommandContext]; [TokenizerTest]; [ParsingTest]; [TokenParserTest]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.44
LapisBlue_Commons,blue.lapis.common.command.impl,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: blue.lapis.common.command.impl; blue.lapis.common.command
LapisBlue_Commons,blue.lapis.common.command.impl,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): blue.lapis.common.command
LapisBlue_Commons,blue.lapis.common.command.impl,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature.
