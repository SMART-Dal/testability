Following fields are declared in this class: letter
w3blogfr_zebra-zpl,fr.w3blog.zpl.constant,ZebraPrintMode,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: desiredMode; prePeelSelect
w3blogfr_zebra-zpl,fr.w3blog.zpl.constant,ZebraFont,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: letter
w3blogfr_zebra-zpl,fr.w3blog.zpl.utils,ZebraUtils,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
