Jimmy-Shi_bean-query,cn.jimmyshi.beanquery.selectors,ClassSelectorTest.ClassWithNotReadableProperty,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: name; notReadable
