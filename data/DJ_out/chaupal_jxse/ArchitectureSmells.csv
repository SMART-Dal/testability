Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
chaupal_jxse,tutorial.advertisement,Scattered Functionality,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: net.jxta.document; net.jxta.id.
chaupal_jxse,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 15.27.
