Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
mozilla_j2me.js,javax.bluetooth,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: javax.bluetooth; com.sun.jsr082.bluetooth
mozilla_j2me.js,javax.bluetooth,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: javax.bluetooth; com.sun.jsr082.bluetooth; com.sun.jsr082.bluetooth.btl2cap
mozilla_j2me.js,javax.bluetooth,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): com.sun.jsr082.bluetooth
mozilla_j2me.js,javax.bluetooth,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [UUID; DiscoveryAgent; LocalDevice; BluetoothStateException; DiscoveryListener; DeviceClass; ServiceRegistrationException; ServiceRecord; RemoteDevice; DataElement]; [BluetoothConnectionException]; [L2CAPConnection; L2CAPConnectionNotifier]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.23
mozilla_j2me.js,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 7.59.
