Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
exteso_alf.io,alfio.repository,God Component,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 34
exteso_alf.io,alfio.repository,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: alfio.repository; alfio.util
exteso_alf.io,alfio.repository,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: alfio.repository; alfio.model; alfio.util
exteso_alf.io,alfio.repository,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: alfio.repository; alfio.model; alfio.util; alfio.controller.api.support
exteso_alf.io,alfio.repository,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): alfio.model.modification; alfio.extension; alfio.manager; alfio.manager.support; alfio.config
exteso_alf.io,alfio.repository,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [SponsorScanRepository]; [AdditionalServiceTextRepository]; [FieldRepository; TicketFieldRepository]; [UploadedResourceRepository]; [FileUploadRepository]; [ExtensionRepository]; [InvoiceSequencesRepository]; [EventAdminRepository]; [TicketCategoryDescriptionRepository]; [TicketCategoryRepository]; [OrganizationDeleterRepository]; [AuditingRepository]; [BillingDocumentRepository]; [EmailMessageRepository]; [EventDeleterRepository]; [GroupRepository]; [TicketSearchRepository]; [SpecialPriceRepository]; [AdditionalServiceRepository]; [SubscriptionRepository]; [PromoCodeDiscountRepository]; [WaitingQueueRepository]; [AdminReservationRequestRepository]; [PollRepository]; [TicketRepository; EventRepository; EventRepositoryIntegrationTest; TicketReservationRepository]; [ExtensionLogRepository]; [DynamicFieldTemplateRepository]; [EventDescriptionRepository]; [AdditionalServiceItemRepository]; [TransactionRepository]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.88
exteso_alf.io,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 12.56.
