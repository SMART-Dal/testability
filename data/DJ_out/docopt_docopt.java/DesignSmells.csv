docopt_docopt.java,(default package),NavalFate,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
docopt_docopt.java,org.docopt,Command,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
docopt_docopt.java,org.docopt,Command,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Argument
docopt_docopt.java,org.docopt,Pattern,Cyclic Hierarchy,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: LeafPattern
docopt_docopt.java,org.docopt,Pattern.MatchResult,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: match; left; collected
docopt_docopt.java,org.docopt,Pattern.MatchResult,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
docopt_docopt.java,org.docopt,Optional,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BranchPattern
docopt_docopt.java,org.docopt,LeafPattern.SingleMatchResult,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: position; match
docopt_docopt.java,org.docopt,LeafPattern.SingleMatchResult,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
docopt_docopt.java,org.docopt,DocoptLanguageError,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
docopt_docopt.java,org.docopt,Docopt,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e. WMC) is: 103
docopt_docopt.java,org.docopt,Python,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: IGNORECASE; MULTILINE
docopt_docopt.java,org.docopt,Python.Re,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: IGNORECASE; MULTILINE
