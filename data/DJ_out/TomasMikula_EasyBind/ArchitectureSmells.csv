Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
TomasMikula_EasyBind,org.fxmisc.easybind,God Component,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 31
TomasMikula_EasyBind,org.fxmisc.easybind,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.fxmisc.easybind; org.fxmisc.easybind.monadic
TomasMikula_EasyBind,org.fxmisc.easybind,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Subscription; Subscription.BiSubscription; Subscription.MultiSubscription; When; When.ConditionalSubscription; ConditionalBinding; EasyBind; FlatMapBindingBase; FlatMapBindingBase.FlatMapBinding; FlatMapBindingBase.FlatMapProperty; MonadicWrapper; ListBindText; ConditionalBindingTest; CombineListTest; Counter; WhenTest; IncludeWhenTest; MonadicTest; SelectTest; PreboundBinding]; [MappedList]; [EasyBind.TriFunction]; [EasyBind.TetraFunction]; [EasyBind.PentaFunction]; [EasyBind.HexaFunction]; [FirstNonNullBinding]; [ListCombinationBinding]; [MonadicTest.A]; [MonadicTest.B]; [SelectTest.A]; [SelectTest.B]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.39
TomasMikula_EasyBind,org.fxmisc.easybind.monadic,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.fxmisc.easybind.monadic; org.fxmisc.easybind
TomasMikula_EasyBind,org.fxmisc.easybind.monadic,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): org.fxmisc.easybind
