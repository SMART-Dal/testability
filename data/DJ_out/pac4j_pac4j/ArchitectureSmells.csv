pac4j_pac4j,org.pac4j.core.context,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.pac4j.core.context; org.pac4j.core.util
pac4j_pac4j,org.pac4j.core.context,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.pac4j.core.context; org.pac4j.core.util; org.pac4j.core.exception.http
pac4j_pac4j,org.pac4j.core.context,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.pac4j.core.context; org.pac4j.core.util; org.pac4j.core.http.adapter; org.pac4j.core.exception.http
pac4j_pac4j,org.pac4j.core.context,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): org.pac4j.core.util
pac4j_pac4j,org.pac4j.core.context,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [JEEContextFactory; JEEContext; WebContextHelper; HttpConstants; Cookie; WebContext; WebContextFactory; MockWebContext]; [HttpConstants.HTTP_METHOD]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.22
pac4j_pac4j,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 10.07.
