stephenostermiller_qqwing,com.qqwing,LogType,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: description
stephenostermiller_qqwing,com.qqwing,Action,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
stephenostermiller_qqwing,com.qqwing,LogItem,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: QQWing; LogItem
stephenostermiller_qqwing,com.qqwing,QQWingMain,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
stephenostermiller_qqwing,com.qqwing,QQWingMain,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e. WMC) is: 134
stephenostermiller_qqwing,com.qqwing,QQWingMain.QQWingOptions,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
stephenostermiller_qqwing,com.qqwing,QQWingMain.QQWingOptions,Broken Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields are declared in this class: printPuzzle; printSolution; printHistory; printInstructions; timer; countSolutions; action; logHistory; printStyle; numberToGenerate; printStats; difficulty; symmetry; threads
stephenostermiller_qqwing,com.qqwing,PrintStyle,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
stephenostermiller_qqwing,com.qqwing,Symmetry,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
stephenostermiller_qqwing,com.qqwing,Difficulty,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
stephenostermiller_qqwing,com.qqwing,QQWing,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: QQWING_VERSION; NL; GRID_SIZE; ROW_COL_SEC_SIZE; SEC_GROUP_SIZE; BOARD_SIZE; POSSIBILITY_SIZE; random; lastSolveRound; puzzle; solution; solutionRound; possibilities; randomBoardArray; randomPossibilityArray; recordHistory; logHistory; solveHistory; solveInstructions; printStyle
stephenostermiller_qqwing,com.qqwing,QQWing,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 37 public methods
stephenostermiller_qqwing,com.qqwing,QQWingTest,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
