Wolfgang-Schuetzelhofer_jcypher,iot.jcypher.domainquery,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: iot.jcypher.domainquery; iot.jcypher.query.writer; iot.jcypher.database; iot.jcypher.domainquery.internal
Wolfgang-Schuetzelhofer_jcypher,iot.jcypher.domainquery,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: iot.jcypher.domainquery; iot.jcypher.query.writer; iot.jcypher.query; iot.jcypher.query.values; iot.jcypher.domainquery.internal
Wolfgang-Schuetzelhofer_jcypher,iot.jcypher.domainquery,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): iot.jcypher.query.factories.clause
Wolfgang-Schuetzelhofer_jcypher,iot.jcypher.domainquery,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [QueryPersistor; InternalAccess; QueryLoader; AbstractDomainQuery; QueryMemento; CountQueryResult; DomainQuery; DomainQueryResult; GDomainQuery]; [AbstractDomainQuery.IntAccess]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.2
Wolfgang-Schuetzelhofer_jcypher,iot.jcypher.domainquery,Scattered Functionality,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: iot.jcypher.domainquery.api; iot.jcypher.domainquery.internal.
Wolfgang-Schuetzelhofer_jcypher,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 9.57.
