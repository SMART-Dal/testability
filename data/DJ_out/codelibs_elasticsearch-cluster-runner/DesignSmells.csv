Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Design Smell,Cause of the Smell
codelibs_elasticsearch-cluster-runner,org.codelibs.elasticsearch.runner,ClusterRunnerException,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
codelibs_elasticsearch-cluster-runner,org.codelibs.elasticsearch.runner,ElasticsearchClusterRunner,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: logger; NODE_NAME; HTTP_PORT; LOG4J2_PROPERTIES; ELASTICSEARCH_YAML; MODULE_TYPES; DATA_DIR; LOGS_DIR; CONFIG_DIR; nodeList; envList; pluginList; maxHttpPort; basePath; confPath; dataPath; logsPath; numOfNode; baseHttpPort; clusterName; indexStoreType; useLogger; disableESLogger; useConsoleAppender; printOnFailure; moduleTypes; pluginTypes; settingsBuilder; errorList; configList
codelibs_elasticsearch-cluster-runner,org.codelibs.elasticsearch.runner,ElasticsearchClusterRunner,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 63 public methods
codelibs_elasticsearch-cluster-runner,org.codelibs.elasticsearch.runner,ElasticsearchClusterRunner.CleanUpFileVisitor,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: errorList
codelibs_elasticsearch-cluster-runner,org.codelibs.elasticsearch.runner,ElasticsearchClusterRunner.CleanUpFileVisitor,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
codelibs_elasticsearch-cluster-runner,org.codelibs.elasticsearch.runner,ElasticsearchClusterRunner.Builder,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
codelibs_elasticsearch-cluster-runner,org.codelibs.elasticsearch.runner,ElasticsearchClusterRunner.Configs,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: configList
codelibs_elasticsearch-cluster-runner,org.codelibs.elasticsearch.runner,ElasticsearchClusterRunner.Configs,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
codelibs_elasticsearch-cluster-runner,org.codelibs.elasticsearch.runner,ElasticsearchClusterRunner.BuilderCallback,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
codelibs_elasticsearch-cluster-runner,org.codelibs.elasticsearch.runner,ElasticsearchClusterRunnerTest,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because test_runCluster is more interested in members of the type: ElasticsearchClusterRunner
codelibs_elasticsearch-cluster-runner,org.codelibs.elasticsearch.runner.node,ClusterRunnerNode,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
codelibs_elasticsearch-cluster-runner,org.elasticsearch.plugins,ClusterRunnerPluginsService,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
