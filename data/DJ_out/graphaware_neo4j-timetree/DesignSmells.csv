graphaware_neo4j-timetree,com.graphaware.module.timetree,CustomRootTimeTree,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): SingleTimeTree
graphaware_neo4j-timetree,com.graphaware.module.timetree,SingleTimeTree,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class is highly complex. The sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods of this class (i.e. WMC) is: 106
graphaware_neo4j-timetree,com.graphaware.module.timetree,SingleTimeTree.ChildNotFoundPolicy,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
graphaware_neo4j-timetree,com.graphaware.module.timetree,SingleTimeTree.ChildNotFoundPolicy,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.
