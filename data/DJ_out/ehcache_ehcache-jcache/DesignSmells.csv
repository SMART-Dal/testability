Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Design Smell,Cause of the Smell
ehcache_ehcache-jcache,org.ehcache.jcache,JCacheEntryEventAdapter,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: JCacheStatMXBean; JCache; JCacheConfiguration; JCacheListenerAdapter; JCacheEntryEventAdapter; JCacheManager; JCacheCachingProvider; JCacheMXBean; JCacheManagementMXBean
ehcache_ehcache-jcache,org.ehcache.jcache,JCacheManagementMXBean,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): JCacheMXBean
ehcache_ehcache-jcache,org.ehcache.jcache,JCacheCacheWriterAdapter,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
ehcache_ehcache-jcache,org.ehcache.jcache,JCacheCopyOnWriteStrategy,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
ehcache_ehcache-jcache,org.ehcache.jcache,JCacheCopyOnWriteStrategy.PreferredClassLoaderObjectInputSteam,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: classLoader

(Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
ehcache_ehcache-jcache,org.ehcache.jcache,JCacheConfiguration,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 22 public methods
ehcache_ehcache-jcache,org.ehcache.jcache,JCacheStatMXBean,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): JCacheMXBean
ehcache_ehcache-jcache,org.ehcache.jcache,JCacheEntry,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

ehcache_ehcache-jcache,org.ehcache.jcache,JCache.JMutableEntry,Broken Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields are declared in this class: jCache; key; fromLoader; initialValue; newValue; updated; deleted; skipDelete
ehcache_ehcache-jcache,org.ehcache.jcache.tck,TCKMBeanServerBuilder,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
ehcache_ehcache-jcache,org.ehcache.jcache.tck,TCKMBeanServerBuilder.RIMBeanServerDelegate,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: delegate
