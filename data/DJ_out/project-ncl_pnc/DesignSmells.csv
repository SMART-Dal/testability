project-ncl_pnc,org.jboss.pnc.restclient,AdvancedSCMRepositoryClient.SCMCreationResult,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: success; scmRepositoryCreationSuccess; repositoryCreationFailure
project-ncl_pnc,org.jboss.pnc.restclient,AdvancedSCMRepositoryClient.SCMCreationResult,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
project-ncl_pnc,org.jboss.pnc.restclient,AdvancedBuildClient,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
project-ncl_pnc,org.jboss.pnc.restclient,AdvancedBuildClient,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BuildClient
project-ncl_pnc,org.jboss.pnc.restclient,AdvancedBuildConfigurationClient,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): BuildConfigurationClient
project-ncl_pnc,org.jboss.pnc.restclient.websocket,VertxWebSocketClient,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 25 public methods
