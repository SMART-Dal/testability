poetix_protonpack,com.codepoetics.protonpack,EmptySeq,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
poetix_protonpack,com.codepoetics.protonpack,GroupRunsSpliterator,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
poetix_protonpack,com.codepoetics.protonpack,PairSeq,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
poetix_protonpack,com.codepoetics.protonpack,StreamUtils,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 37 public methods
poetix_protonpack,com.codepoetics.protonpack,Streamable,Cyclic Hierarchy,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on one of its subclasses (creating cycle in the hierarchy). The class is dependent on the following subclass: Seq
poetix_protonpack,com.codepoetics.protonpack,AggregatingSpliterator,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
poetix_protonpack,com.codepoetics.protonpack.maps,DefaultMapStream,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
poetix_protonpack,com.codepoetics.protonpack.maps,DefaultMapStream,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 40 public methods
poetix_protonpack,com.codepoetics.protonpack.stateful,ComposedStateMachine,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
poetix_protonpack,com.codepoetics.protonpack.stateful,Statefully,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
poetix_protonpack,com.codepoetics.protonpack.stateful,StateMachineRunner,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: StateMachineRunner; StateMachine
poetix_protonpack,com.codepoetics.protonpack.collectors,CompletableFutures.FutureReducer,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
poetix_protonpack,com.codepoetics.protonpack.collectors,CompletableFutures.SingleFutureReducer,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
poetix_protonpack,com.codepoetics.protonpack.collectors,CompletableFutures.SingleFutureReducer,Broken Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields are declared in this class: futureCount; resultsReceived; output; exception; accumulator; reducer; combiner
poetix_protonpack,com.codepoetics.protonpack.collectors,CompletableFutures.CombinedFutureReducer,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: left; right; combiner
poetix_protonpack,com.codepoetics.protonpack.collectors,CompletableFutures.CombinedFutureReducer,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
poetix_protonpack,com.codepoetics.protonpack.collectors,NonUniqueValueException,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
