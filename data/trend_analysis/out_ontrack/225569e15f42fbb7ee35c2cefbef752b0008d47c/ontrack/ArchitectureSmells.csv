Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
ontrack,net.nemerosa.ontrack.repository.support,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ConfiguredDBInit; DBInitConfig; AbstractDBInitConfig]; [AbstractJdbcRepository]; [AbstractJdbcRepositoryTest]; [DBMigrationPatch]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.67
ontrack,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 7.82.
