ontrack,net.nemerosa.ontrack.extension.support,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [AbstractExtensionController]; [Weather]; [AbstractExtensionFeature]; [ConfigurationHealthIndicator]; [AbstractConfigurationService]; [AbstractExtension]; [AbstractPropertyType].
